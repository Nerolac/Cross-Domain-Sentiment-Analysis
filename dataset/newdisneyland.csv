0,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,1
25843,"Just got back from California for my 4 year old's first experience of Disneyland... we had a blast! The updates to the park have been done beautifully, and the maintenance of the park is awesome... it's as magical as i remember it, only better as time goes by. All the 'cast members' were pleasant and lovely, curtsie ing (sp?!) to my daughter and adressing her as  Princess.  She loved it. We did a 5 day park hopper... which i found was a day or two too much for a little girl. next time, i think we'll go with a 3 day park hopper, and have a few days in between to relax, etc... we discovered that leaving the parks for lunch and a swim nap is the way to go... the last 2 days we did that, we had zero meltdowns and or tantrums... and it was 107 degrees! Came back into the parks for rides one night, and Fantasmic the next... she loved being up so late, and i loved how beautiful the park was at night... (p.s. Jungle Cruise, Big Thunder, and Dumbo are WAY better at night!)Fabulous first Disney vacation... makes me want to start planning the next trip!",1
25863,"Not much to say about the park that pretty much everyone has been to. Its still the best and still worthy of anyone's time to visit.We really enjoyed our trip in August this year and the weather was great, the crowds not too bad. Disappointed my son beat me on Buzz, but I got him back by taking him on Casey Jnrs circus train. Its a small world is too enjoyable to use as punishment :)Lovely to see characters wandering around free at times, something you don't see in Orlando parks with plenty of fun interaction. You can't go wrong with Disneyland and we can't wait to go back.",1
25864,we went last month with our 4 yr old and the experience was amazing . we just went for 1 day due to short of time but it was totally worth it.. my daughter totally enjoyed it..Looking forward to go anytime..i loved the snacks they have there its soo healthy fruits with little spices...woww it was amazing..,1
25865,"No one does this kind of attraction like Disney does. The replication of the Radiator Springs and the surrounding area is beyond description. We went during the  slowest weeks of the year . Thank goodness because I hate crowds. There seemed to be a lot of break downs in California Adventure the day we were there which cause a rift in our plans and made for some extra walking. Numerous rides including the coaster were on and off all day. (safety first).I agree with  claucrasoda  who said  if you are not a patient person or dislike crowds then stay away....  We have a special needs child but even with a guest assistance pass there are waits and disappointments. If you have a child under 40  tall DO NOT get in line until you make sure they can ride rather than find out after waiting in line. If the child is close to 40  put a pair of shoes on them with thick souls and heals. Disney DOES NOT make exceptions to the height requirements.Disneyland is NOT inexpensive. You won't enjoy it if you are worried about how much things cost there. Plan ahead, over budget and enjoy. If you pay $7 for a corn dog just know that it is the best corn dog in the world :)",1
25866,"My wife and I took our 7 and 6 year olds to Disney for the first time last week. This was also my first time to Disneyland so I wasn't sure what to expect although I had heard plenty of good stories. We spent Friday and Saturday there and chose the week after Labor Day as we had heard the park wasn't too crowded that week. I was surprised at the amount of people that were there even though it was a school week. Nevertheless, the crowds were not too big to cause us to buy the Fastpass. The park was very clean   lots of staff cleaning. The attractions were all well maintained and plenty of cast members working to keep lines manageable. We ate lunch at the Carnation Cafe and had a good, friendly server and the meal was enjoyable and timely. All of the cast members we interacted with were friendly and helpful. I left feeling good about getting our money's worth and would visit again. Although, I will probably choose a school week again because I would expect the crowds during the summer or holidays to be more than I would want to experience.",1
25867,"No matter what age you are, this is the place to go and play.You get a lot for your money. If you go often, buy an annual passand parking pass. It is really an all day fun adventure. If it is crowdeduse the fast pass. They really do work.",1
25868,If you are looking to spend quality time with your children...this is the place...if you are not a patient person or dislike crowds then stay away...come early stay at the Disney resorts and enjoy ealry admission this helps you avoid crowds inside Fantasyland and you can enjoy the coolness of the morning...watch Fantasmic at the Riverbelle while you have dinner and don't forget to be a kid again!,1
25869,"I went to Disneyland in 1989, I was 22 but I have magical memories of it. I left my age at the gate and regressed to childhood. Expensive? Yes but what price can you put on feeling young at heart again.",1
25870,Does Disneyland even need a review?  It's amazing and everyone should go at least twice in their lives.  But of course it's crowded and pricey.  Bring your own water bottles and pack a sandwich for lunch.,1
25872,"Weekdays no fast passes, it was very quick to get through on a Monday, i would recommend going during the week if you can",1
25873,"My family of 6 just went to Disneyland, we haven't been in years. I was floored to see the price of admission. $87 for one park or $125 for a park hopper. Needless to say it hits the pocket book FAST. A friend told me about ticketsinc1.com they have hopper tickets for just $99. With a savings of $26 per person, we were able to enjoy both parks get a turkey leg and buy a souvenir. Awesome!",1
25874,No line and no wait longer than 10 minutes. Most of the kids with us were from NZ and Aust so they were able to go on all the rides that were open.,1
25875,"This was one of the best days my family has ever had. The park is super clean, with lots of great rides that didn't break down. Characters were around the park, the food was great at the special restaurant in the pirates of the Caribbean ride. This is an amazing place.",1
25876,I finally to step on ground to Walt's famous park and almost put me to tears.. after singing and humming to Walts cartoons and movie 30 years ago and now 30 years later.. it embraced me with open arms.. I took the nostalgic walk and rides and I'm a kid again. You have to be here minimum 2 days to enjoy the Park..avoid weekends if you dont want to wait close to 90 minutes to their famous rides. Total 100% Fun.. I'll be back.,1
25879,The worst day at Disney is better thatn the best day anywhere where else. We had a great time and can't wait to get back again!,1
25880,I really enjoyed taking the family this year. The park was fun I especially love some of the new rides. We have a little one and she was able to ride allot of rides. Family had a good time and we had no trouble getting on the rides. Downtown Disney was great too we ate at the Rain Forrest Cafe I recommend it. If money is tight there are allot of food choices nearby. There were plenty of characters around to take pictures with. A great place for the family.,1
25862,"LOVE Disneyland! I did encounter some unhappy employees. Heard many complaining about hours and such and a few were a bit snappy. Can't say I really blame them tho, not sure I would do any better dealing with all those people. It seems like the general public leaves their brains and manners at the gate as the walk in.",1
25861,"Disney is the best hands down and we love going back again and again. They have the best service, and environment! We love Disney! Thanks for a great visit!",1
25860,"Must see. Newest attraction @ Disneyland,Anaheim,CA. Get to park early because Fast Pass go quickly and average non pass wait is about an hour.",1
25851,"A lot of fun for kids of all ages. Getting a bit expensive, but the annual passes pay for themselves after a couple of visits. It is also nice to have them since you can visit both parks. IF Disney is too busy, we just go to California adventure.",1
25845,Loved it! We had a 3 day park hopper ticket and could have spent more time there. The evening shows were amazing. Great rides for kids ( aged 6 & 8),1
25846,"Halloween overlays for Space Mountain & the Haunted Mansion were up   great!  Lines were minimal mid week, but very long on Friday.",1
25847,"We have grown to love Disneyland... we have been three times in the past two years. For such a stressful and chaotic place, it can actually be quite relaxing if you keep it simple. I strongly recommend staying on site and spending a minimum of 3 nights 4 days. It will be spendy but worth it.The first two trips we stayed at the Grand Californian Hotel, which I highly recommend. It is closest to the park and allows for lot of breaks and quick trips to the room. This year we tried the Disneyland Hotel, which was very nice, but not as convenient. I will still recommend it if you can get a considerably better deal than the GC. The Disney properties are significantly more money, but I think they are well worth it for the convenience (location, nice pools, etc.).From SNA (John Wayne Orange County Airport) there is a very convenient shuttle bus that takes you directly to your hotel. It is inexpensive and runs frequently (every 30   60 minutes). We have found this so much easier and less stressful than renting a car and dealing with traffic, parking, etc.Our first two trips we spent 3 nights and 4 days and this trip we spent 4 nights and 5 days.Be sure to get a Hopper pass and get the extra day. It is worth it for night shows (World of Color, Fireworks and Fantasmic)Vons (Safeway) offers FREE online delivery service (first purchase). All Disney hotel rooms have a fridge. I recommend stocking up on breakfast and lunch snacks. You can schedule the delivery for the day you arrive. The hotel will hold your items. We scheduled a 2 3 PM delivery on the day we checked in.It is also VERY helpful to make dinner reservations in advance. I recommend Naples and Jazz Kitchen in Downtown Disney.Don't miss the fireworks, World of Color show and Fantastic show (9 PM). They are all wonderful. The parades are also pretty magical. I recommend the VIP Fantasmic Dessert    you will have a great reserved seat (spendy but worth it!).I also highly recommend the Aladdin play (45 minutes) and the  It's Tough to be a Bug  movie (15 minutes)    Very wonderful experiences!Rides like Tower of Terror, Indiana Jones and Space Mountain can be scary    Use caution. Try rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain Railroad and the Haunted Mansion first (they are our favorites just slightly scary thrill). Also be sure to spend some time on Tom Sawyer's Island    lots of cool cave's to explore.",1
25848,"I have always dreamed of visiting this great place since i was a child, i used to watch Disneyland every Sunday at 6 o'clock as a child, this was the highlight of my week. Now i have finally been and the memory will stay with me forever! ",1
25849,Great place   a must see if you are in LA.You need at least a whole day if not two or three...... !You gotta be patient   lots of people there but great fun   sometimes you need to stand in line for up to 1 hour or more unless you the check in system wich is A OK.It is pricy   but worth it : )))Gotta go there again!,1
25850,Only disliked the heat. Wasn't expecting that.    Everything else was love!  Loved the Jack Skellington overlay at the Haunted Mansion,1
25852,We loved the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique and all the opportunities to meet characters.  Our family's favourite ride was Star Tours   we couldn't get enough of it!,1
25859,Parks are extremely clean. All staff and crewmembers are friendly and helpful. The rides are fun and there is so much to do for any age group. Can't wait to go back!,1
25853,"Lots of rides needed upgrading (Big Thunder Mountain kept breaking down, Matterhorn bobsleds was so rickety it was quite painful) but I still loved this park. Space Mountain was much faster than I remembered and Star Tours has totally changed their simulator ride   much more fun now! Indiana Jones was the BEST with lots of excellent and fun surprises! DO NOT MISS THIS RIDE!Don't forget to buy your Star Tours tshirt, you can't get it anywhere else but in Tomorrowland.And spare some time to visit Downtown Disney after you're done at this park   there is a D Street there that sells things not found in the park (especially vinylmations!).",1
25854,"Just got back from a three day hopper at Disneyland. Our first time to anything Disney and it was pretty great! Monday and Tuesday...the weather was pleasant and the lines low. Basically walked on to all the classic rides (teacups, dumbo, etc.). We got an idea of what summer is like on Friday when temps got up to 105 and the crowds increased. Uck.We learned how to catch all the princesses within about an hour. Near It's a Small World, they have a princess meet and greet where they line up three to four princesses at a time. They change out every 30 minutes or so. Wait in line to see the first set of princesses and then get back in line and get to the front...then let everyone pass until the next set of princesses arrive. We met Tianna, Aurora, Cinderella, Belle, Jasmine, Snow White and Ariel this way. ALL of the characters went out of their way to make the moments special for our little girl. We were very pleased! When trying to meet Tinkerbell at Pixie Hollow, be sure to ask whether she is in or not before waiting in line. Was a little frustrating waiting a long time and then meeting other pixies. The autograph books worked great (they have a generic disney book and a princess book). I'd suggest buying atleast one of the big fat pens (of course Disney sells them: ), as they are easier for the bigger characters like Mickey and Minney to use.We noticed lots of complaints about the staff on tripadvisor. We weren't blown away by their hospitality and service, but we weren't disappointed either. I'd say they were average. The Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo Boutique was wonderful. They made my daughter so beautiful and feel so special. Well worth the cost.My husband and son did the  Discover the Magic  tour and had fun. It's based on a the kids exploring the park and solving a mystery with two Disney tour guides. They got to ride 4 or 5 rides, bypassing the lines, and met Mickey at the end. They also got a snack drink at the end. Similar to the staff comment above, the tour guides were average, but certainly didn't make it  magical.  Our kids loved the Dole Whip. We took advantage of the Tiki Show that accompanies the Dole Whip stand. We got our dessert quicker by going inside the waiting area and ordering there...and then going into the show. We hadn't planned to go to the show, but it proved to be a nice break from the crowds and heat...and we got to finally enjoy the ice cream concoction! Goofy's Kitchen was a lot of fun and the food was abundant. Great variety of adult and children's favorites (mac & cheese pizza, peanut butter and jelly pizza, and all kinds of  goofy  creations). The characters made it memorable and fun.Our  Magic Morning  was a little confusing. We weren't allowed into Disney Adventure (even though the web site says that they are open for magic morning) and the rides were limited in Disneyland. Not a big deal, but we were a little disappointed.California Adventure was ok. We spent most of our time in the boardwalk area riding the classic rides (swings, rollercoaster, ferris wheel). We waited very little. Carsland was nuts...really busy. We weren't willing to wait 90  minutes for the big rides (and we were too late for the fast pass), so we moved on. The Mater ride was fun. We also had a good time in the Bugs area. Lunch at Ariel's Grotto was nice. Expensive, but fun to watch our daughter waiting and meeting more princesses. Overall, we had a great time at Disneyland!",1
25855,Wow! Disney is everything they say and more! It's just magical and there is no excuse for not taking your children there. Literally magical. The parade at 7pm is also pretty awesome and you get to see all of the characters together.,1
25856,It was hubby and son's first trip. We went on an off season so there were some rides down for refurbs but there is so much to do. We are just sitting here wondering why we just didn't do this wonderful trip earlier.,1
25857,"I was born in HB in the 1960's and my folks would take us to Disneyland at least once a year. My husband and I visited the coast in HB last week for a few days and we also went to Disneyland. He had never been there. We both really enjoyed it, we went just after school started so the wait times for the rides were not at all long waits and we were there on a weekday. My favorite ride has always been Pirates of the Carribean and my husband said that was his favorite also. We also enjoyed riding the monorail for a little scenic sit down break around the park. Out of all the times I've been to Disneyland, that was the first time I ever rode that ride lol. I was really disappointed though because the Haunted Mansion was closed :( That was also one of my favorites and that's all I talked about to my husband for several days before we got there. That was minor though compared to the rest of the park. A great time once again at the Happiest place on earth!",1
25858,We really liked Disneyland Park. The weather was very hot during our stay and some of the lines offered relief from that. We wished that the bathrooms were more frequent easier to find. Also there wasn't very many Disney Photopass photographers around during our visit. They seemed to be all at California Adventure. There was plenty to do and more than enough to keep my kids talking about it for years on end.,1
25881,"Better than the Orlando park, because you don't have to walk miles to see the attractions. Take advantage of the  no waiting   event tickets. Don't miss the Blue Bayue restaurant ( in the swamp).",1
25882,"It's Disney.....need I say any more? Before you go, just make sure on the hours. When I made reservations to go, the hours were to 10:00 pm and when we got there, they closed at 5 for a private party. I felt a little jipped but otherwise had a great time.",1
25883,"Cannot fault Disney, the always get the details right.  It really is the happiest place on earth!   Happy staff, friendly people, only  problem  was Disney Adventure closed at 10pm the day before a public holiday??!",1
25911,"I love Disneyland, and ever trip is just as special as the first visit. Always clean and beautiful. My only compliant would be actually be against some of the inconsiderate patrons with their enormous strollers that mow you down at any given chance. Please people not all of us that enjoy disney, have children. And those of you who have half a sense to watch where your going, I thank you.",1
25905,We enjoyed more rides at the park this time as everyone seemed to be at California Adventure Park. Wait time was just the walk through the entrance on many rides.Good time to take advantage of short lines for us.More leaves on the ground than we had seen on previous trips   must be the time of year. Park personnel were busy as usual cleaning everywhere.,1
25906,"Wonderful park, pricey food. Had a great time with the family. Better off going here than accross to the California adventure.",1
25907,"You can never go wrong with Disney. The park is like entering a time warp into a simpler happier place. They keep it as clean as anything you have ever seen. The staff is as pleasant as any group of employees I have ever dealt with. I would recommend a trip here for all, regardless of age. You won't be disappointed.",1
25908,"It's Disneyland what can I say? Every family needs at least one well planned out, and saved for vacation to this park. Do your research, save your money, if its done right this is a vacation that can be the best one you'll have.",1
25909,We must have we on the hottest day! The lines were a bit long but this was a trip that my whole family and I will never forget! Nothing like creating memories.,1
25910,"DL was not crowded on Thursday so we were able to finish mostly everything. Lines were short and waiting times were down to a minimum. Not as hot as it would be in July. Little cooler and the night was warm too, just a slight chill. You don't even need a jacket.",1
25912,It opens 10am to 12 pm. You can leave and re enter the park the whole day. The 15 min fireworks daily starting at 9:30PM. Must see Jungle Tour and It's A Small World.,1
25902,Disneyland as always was fun. Food is always expensive and water. Bring in your own water bottle and save.,1
25913,"Visited the original park from the UK for the first time and had mixed feelings. As a regular to Orlando we found the park rather busier than expected but felt the sense of history and classic nature of the park was enough to outweigh the slightly claustrophobic feel of the crowds. Best of the park for us were Astro Blasters, Star Tours (much improved with the new films!) and Indiana Jones. Also do NOT miss the Fantasmic show which we felt was better than Orlando (look a full size pirate ship!). However we do not understand the love for some of the older classic attractions (Matterhorn Bobsleds?) and the Captain Eo 3D show was hilariously bad!",1
25914,"Everything, Everything! Your first trip and each time after will be fun! I dont like it that the characters are so out of view during the day. I dont understand why in the area of Hollywood, they cant find a Talking Mickey Mouse! Indiana Jones ride    so fun! Star Wars  wow they can all be Virtual if they could be like that! Love the Burgers there in that part of the park by the Matterhorn. Best if you can figure out how to use the Fast Pass!",1
25915,"Disneyland is magical no matter how you cut it, but the disaster of Radiator Springs was a bit too much. The ride broke down 5 times in one day, and we took a last ditch effort 5 minutes before closing ... we waited about 35 minutes and got on but it wasn't worth the wait ... or the stress of wondering if waiting at midnight with a 6 year old for a ride that may or may not be working by the time we get there, was a good idea. I felt sorry for the people who waited 2.5 hours!That being said, of course the trip was great and the highlight of our son's summer, I just wish we hadn't worked our last day around waiting to get on that ride, and going back and forth between parks to facilitate it. We were told that this ride has been very unreliable. Advice? (1) Go on a magic morning and have someone line up right away so you're there when the park opens or (b) have someone line up there while someone gets a fast pass at park opening (fast passes are gone within 30 mins or 60 mins of opening on a busy day (3) or wait until the novelty of the ride passes and the lineups shorten and the staff work through the ride's glitches.",1
25916,"We were on a 5 day trip to LA. Friends who had been there earlier advised us to avoid the weekend crowd. So, we decided to visit the Disney parks during weekdays. Being there early we were able to avoid the queues and finish most of the rides before lunch. Mickey's Parade was awesome. We had planned the tour around the park before visiting, so we didn't waste much time searching for attractions. What we didn't expect was the heat. Carry lot of water, drinks. It would be nice if the park management could do something to make the heat bearable. As with any amusement park, everything inside is really expensive. If possible buy your lunch outside. It is a huge park with lot of walking to do. Wear comfortable shoes. Strollers are available for rent. If possible take your own to save a few bucks. When travelling with young children, being an early bird has its own advantage. Even though our son napped for about an hour we still had enough time. Leaving the park after the fireworks was difficult because of the huge crowd. Tips:1. Stay close to the park and be as early as possible.2. Wear comfortable clothing.3. Be ready to face the heat.4. Use the online map to plan your visit and save time. 5. Make use of the FastPass facility.",1
25918,The only ride we think is past its best is the Matterhorn. A day and a half was just enough to do everything we wanted. The crowds were less than you might expect for the end of August,1
25919,"Love it!!!  Disney always does it right.  The park is smaller and more  urban  than WDW, but it is a classic!!  I want to go back already.",1
25904,"I love Disney and never get enough of the place, my daughter will be attending Cal State Fullerton and i got her a season pass while she is in school and went together before school started and it was a great way to have some fun, and have some mother daughter time before she became a big college student and i had to go back home to TX;))",1
25901,"The original Disneyland Park is a must visit, at least once (or even more). As a young couple (with no kids) we had a great time enjoying the magic of Disney.I had been about 20 years ago and was very similar to how I remembered it. This is good and bad, and perhaps would have been nice if they had enhanced the park much more than they had (were only a handful of new rides, where I would have expected much more of an overhaul).Was pretty busy which is to be expected and can be some long lines to wait for rides. The best tip is to arrive at park opening (8am) and head around to all the popular rides straight away (Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Roger Rabbit, Space Mountain, Star Wars, etc) and you'll have pretty much no wait   that then leaves the rest of the day to take it easy and enjoy the rest of the park and less busy rides   also make good use of the fast pass system (will save lots of waiting).We managed to see the park in a single day (8am until after the light show finishing about 10 11pm). Was a long day, but managed it even heading out of the park for a couple of hours for dinner. Probably with children, you will need at least 2 days to get around the whole park and see and do most things.Being a theme park, everything is of course designed to get you to spend money on food, clothes, gifts, etc. Some of these were reasonably priced and others a bit expensive   you are allowed to bring your own food into the park, so consider bringing some bottles of water and perhaps lunch snacks to save a few $$$",1
25884,"Whenever our girls and I think of vacation, this is where we always talk about going and always want to be.",1
25892,"We recently visited the two parks Disneyland and Disneyland California for three days. We had also been to Seaworld Legoland and Universal in the same week but more of those in other reviews.We are big fans of Dinsey having been to their parks in Orlando. if you have been to Orlando a lot of things will seem the same as this is where is all began. If you are expecting it too be very different lots of new rides etc go to California as this is the newer parkWe purchased City Pass tickets which give good discount and the park hopper feature although it is a stretch to do more than one park in a day and really enjoy it. This is important to remember dont try to do too much it will spoil your enjoyment and unless you have very resilient kids they will be tired and irritable by the days end.One thing the hopper ticket is useful for if one of you wants to be the queue volunteer. For example at the moment (it changes every day so check) The Cars land main ride is massively popular. Even the fast pass runs out before 10am. Day one it took me 20 30 mins to get fast pass around 9.30am I got tickets to retunr 7.50PM. The next day we went to disneyland then I took the families tickets to get fast pass for the radiator springs racers so we werent all standing in line. There is also a new starbucks just inside on Buena Vista so if you are an SB addict this can be your line up reward.We notice food has gone up a lot in Disney since our last visit and its not as good as Universal or Seaworld for example. $6.50 for a small hot dog $13 for a slice of pizza and if staying in the evening $9 for a wine !. They don't like you to bring food but you might be able to sneak a subway in or say you have special food for the kids. I saw another review on merchandise and agree if you have lots to buy Target  CVS etc but then again you have to hand it too Disney no one has made more gifts out of Mickey than anyone else they have lots of unique items whereas outside the park is more generic stuff.Last few things, have a rough plan it doesnt have to be military style (dont march the kids around to tick everything off it is a holiday) but a little planning will save you time and try to think about alternates, if this ride is full what's next to it.Our favourites all of Cars Land really well done (check out how it was planned in the blue cellar) California Screamin, Nemo and all the old favourites in Disneyland such as small world, space mountain, buzzlightyear to zap some aliens.Mickeys parade is great and also the new pixar parade at California. There is a hot dog stall in the Hollywood are so you can wait in the shade until the parade comes by.Lastly do keep in the shade and drink lots it was 100 plus while we were there and no cooling mist spray unlike Universal.Have fun",1
25885,"Great park, very magical. Clean and friendly staff. Great rides, short lines. Food could be better quality. Liked much more than Disney world, FL.",1
25886,There aren't enough words to describe how much fun I had at Disneyland. I felt like a kid again. So much to see and do. The rides are amazing and the night show and fireworks were spectacular,1
25887,"Me and my family (hubby, 2 kids 14&12) visited in August 2012 and had a great time. We have been to Disneyworld Florida twice and thought it would be nice to be able to compare the 2. In my opinion Disneyworld Florida wins purely because there is so much more to do there..yes size does matter!! That said we did enjoy our experience in California, the parks were walkable from our hotel, a big bonus as no costly parking fees and able to nip back to the hotel pool for a cool off if needed. We had a 6 day ticket to do Disneyland California adventures and this was definately enough if not 1 day too much..we did everything we wanted to do and some things 3 times over! Being peak season it was busy, as we were there 2 weeks we tried to avoid the weekends as this is when the park is at its busiest and we used the fast passes to good effect. The sun can be very harsh and the heat sometimes close to unbearable, but they were in the middle of a heatwave whilst we were there! Food and drinks seems expensive, expected at theme parks but they do provide water fountains throughout the parks, good for a quick thirst quench. All in all a great time had by all but its back to Florida for us!",1
25888,Never boring for there is sooooo much to see and do and eat! Your experience it different everytime you visit it. I could go all the time. Went on my honeymoon for my first marriage and of course took the kids several times while they were growing up!,1
25890,"What a great place to Honeymoon. Wait times were small because everyone was at Carsland, theres a ride or attraction for almost every Disney movie, and it's so special knowing that Walt was actually there.. We loved everything about Disneyland, and I can't wait to return",1
25891,"Its good for all ages but obviously more for the kids, a fast pass is essential, toilets are hard to find, but you will have a good time.",1
25893,Cars Land was a hoot. We actually got on all 3 of the rides. Instead of waiting in a long line we all went single and got on the ride in 30 minutes instead of 60  minutes. At Luigi's ride a hint is to put arms out and lean. A real hoot of a time.,1
25900,"Disneyland was awesome for the 2 1 2 days we were there!Favorites: Big Thunder Mountain, TeaCups, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pan's FlightTip: Definitely do the Fast Pass. It's free, and is so very helpful! Nothing feels better than walking straight past hundreds of people waiting an hour in line to to straight to the front.If you're not there for the parades fireworks etc., those are great times to take advantage of barely any waits at the popular rides!",1
25894,"The rides are great, but it's disheartening when you stand in line at Pixie Hollow to meet Tinkerbell and there's trash floating in the water next to the line.",1
25895,"Easy to get around, clean, attractive and fun! Could use a larger castle. All in all we liked it better than Disney World's magic kingdom.",1
25896,"I mean, it's disney; what else is there to say?? If you like Disney, this is for you. If you don't... Well you probably wouldn't consider it anyway, right?   Magic Mountain is the best ride, if you ask me.",1
25897,"I just have a few tips for families visiting Disneyland. While watching the prices inflate year after year it has really discouraged me from making any purchases at the park itself. We simply stop by the local CVS store the day before we go and let each child pick out three souvenirs gifts. Then we have them pick out post cards for Grandma, Grandpa and their friends. Now everyone is decked out in their    Disney    apparel and ready to enjoy the park. We only spend about forty dollars on souvenirs gifts and it   s the same items you would buy at the park.I also suggest packing a backpack with small snacks, band aids, hand sanitizer, a few water bottles and a blanket. Yes a blanket. Why? It gets cold in California at night and it will come in handy while watching the parade with your kiddos.Don   t rush your kids through the park; let them enjoy seeing everything us as adults take for granted. Have fun!",1
25898,"We really enjoy Disneyland  Take the time to slow down and enjoy some of the less obvious attractions and shows. exelent exelent,",1
25899,Just like being a kid again.  Glad that I got to take my girls.  One of the happiest places on earth.  You can't help but become a kid again.,1
25844,Fun for everyone! Toddlers can enjoy almost every ride! Every single worker is super nice and happy! Nobody was rude! The guy at the ice cream stand even complimented my pink fingernails! Fantasmic and the fireworks are both amazing shows!! So happy we went! Enjoyed our vacation so much!,1
25842,Disneyland consists of 2 parks plus Downtown Disney. Some things are the same as Disney World but Disneyland also has its unique attractions such as the boardwalk in California adventures. New this year is cars land a day the little Mermaid under water world. Cinderella's castle is much smaller than Florida. All in all it is all Disney magic. You will need 3 days to see and do everything in the 2 parks. Add another day for Disney shopping including Downtown Disney.Recommend the Grand Californian if you are staying on Site. Beautiful with great dining.,1
25921,I've been going to Disneyland my whole life and I can't get enough of it.  It's a great place to visit.  If you haven't been try to go during the fall or winter when the lines are shorter.  Summer was crazy.,1
25840,"This was my third trip to Disneyland as a parent. For our 7 year old it was his first trip. This was also the first trip my wife and I have made to California Adventure Park since it was under construction the last time we went as a family with my three older children. This year we went beginning on Labor Day so we could get the final day of riding Indiana Jones before a major several month long refurbishment. Then we spent a day at Universal Studio's on Tuesday, and returned to Disneyland Parks for Wednesday and Thursday. The biggest surprise was that we expected labor day to be a nightmare with the crowds, and yes it was busy, but with smart usage of the Fastpass system we never waited in any line over 25 minutes in length, and that was the Matterhorn, a non Fastpass ride. The weather was hot, 90ish all days we were there. My single biggest complaint about Disneyland Parks is why on earth they still, after all these years, do not use  cool zones  the same way that we see at Universal Studio's with the big fans blowing mist on you as you wander about the very large theme parks. In heavily sun exposed areas like Tomorrowland andCars Land it would do wonders! Overall the trip was memorable and grand. The evening shows, Fantasmic, Fireworks, and world of color, are breathtaking and very well done. I'd spend a one day park ticket just to see these shows without any rides! So to me that made the trip worth it, and them the rides make it an all day everyday fun experience. I was surprised by the size of California Adventure, so make sure you bring good walking shoes because it more than doubles the walking you once did when it was just Disneyland. The midweek crowd was less populated of course, so ride times were never over 30 minutes for any ride. Tips:Get an early fastpass for world of color and main cars ride, that race, I can't recall it's name, but the line was always awful and no offense but it's not good enough to wait over an hour for, so get a fastpass early and you will be sure to get on the ride before they run out! Fastpass World of Color asap in the morning and then save your spot over an hour in advance for awesome standing room. If your mixing a weekend and weekday trip like we did, make sure you know which attractions are only on weekends so your not disappointed on a Monday when you find things are now closed that you saw open the day before. They need to make that dole cool treats stand a fastpass attraction, the line was as long as ride lines at all hours.",1
25785,"Great rides and easy to have fun for two full days. Some trees (for shelter) and seating (for rest only, not food) would be nice.",1
25786,Glad to see that the Disney park is as much fun now as I remember.  The had the park decorated for Halloween and it was really terrific.  The Holiday mansion with Jack and Sally was really awesome.,1
25787,it was such a fantastic place to be truly happiest place on earth. I really enjoyed rides abd the line ups were about 30 but it moves faster then you think so that was a bonus. We brought water bootes with us so we saved some money there but we ate at the park but the options were not the best we had 2 sandwiches which were not good and a bottle water and the bill came to $30 but it is expected however that did not leave a sour taste cause the park was really clean overall the experience was the best i could have imagined but going to the park was a headace it was so packed with traffic so leave early,1
25788,"Having been to the Park in Florida, we were quite shocked at how small this one was and that it was located in the centre of a residential area.The rides however made up for the disappointment of the size. We managed to do everything in one day. Cast members were very friendlyand there were few queues for the attraction with the exception of the Indian Jones Ride. We booked a fastpass for that   I still preferred the Indiana Jones attraction in Florida.",1
25789,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.  My favourite park and truly the happiest place on earth. The attention to detail blows me away.,1
25790,I love Disneyland but the weather that day was awful. It was so hot. I'll be back in October. I would stay at a closer hotel next time.,1
25791,It's been 10 years since our last visit. Great as always. We didn't realize we could bring in our own food and may have done this. Lunch for 2 was $21 so not bad but $3.99 for one cookie? I don't think so. Line ups were not an issue and they certainly are efficient at moving a crowd. We noticed that at the beginning of one ride it said wait time was 30 minutes but we time it and it was less than 15.,1
25792,We spent 12 days discovering Disneyland and still didn't do everything. The photo pass is great as we have photos of all three of us. This place is magical and we are going back in 10 weeks.,1
25793,There is just something Disney does that no one came come close to! The cast members just add to the experience even more!,1
25794,"Awesome attraction for couples, families, groups, etc.   you literally can't go wrong with a visit to Disney. Some tips:There are numerous sources for detailed tips & hints online for the two parks (Disneyland and California Adventure). Do some research before you go and save time and money.Don't expect it to be cheap   there are a number of ways to reduce costs, but you'll only have heartache if you try to nickel and dime it.Plan to spend at least three days to really see and experience the place.Mid week is typically alot fewer people in the parks so you spend less time in lines.Going in the morning just at the parks open also reduces lines for the first couple hours.Learn to use the FastPass system   this can be thoroughly researched.Use the cast members (employees)   they're a wealth of knowledge and super friendly and helpful.Enjoy! :)",1
25795,Line ups were long but time spent with family priceless. The Fast Passes need a little work but with the volume of people that go through those gates every day it runs pretty smoothly. I am glad to see the cleanliness is back because a couple of years ago I was visiting Disneyland and I was really disappointed with he garbage all over the place. And when one talks about Disneyland one of the first things that comes to mind is how clean they keep the grounds. It shows pride and quality. Enjoy the day and but most of all enjoy the time spent with family and friends because that's what it is about.,1
25796,Great park  some different rides to Florida  & florida one much bigger.long queues but was high summer & had heatwave!! However 3 rides broke down whilst queing in one day!! Always plenty of Disney fun fun fun though to be had....:),1
25798,"Myself and my fianc   went here because it's just something you've gotta do hey !We went mid week and this is the time to go. Less crowds so smaller lines and easily done in 1 day. The rides while mostly aimed at kids were still great fun. There's still some that scare the crap out of you which we loved. Star Wars (not scary but a real thrill ride) was one the best and the line up was half the fun.The food and drinks were reasonably priced (we thought it was going to be expensive) and seeing all the characters walking around made you feel like a kid again. While not the most exciting theme park for adults, it's still worth the visit.. after all, it's Disneyland",1
25799,Only thing we didn't like was having to wait for a table at all resturants when there were tables empty and waiters waitresses just talking and the type of food on offer.,1
25800,"Our 2 kids had a great time at Disneyland, even though some of the rides were too grown up or too scary for them. Luckily we went in off season when the queues weren't too long. And the fireworks on Friday night was definitely worth waiting up for.",1
25784,"Fantastic, friendly, the most feel good place ever.  Loved it would go back in a heartbeat.  Super clean, even crowded everyone is happy to be there.  The people who work there are always eager to help in any way they can.",1
25783,"It was our first time visiting Disneyland and my two year old son had lots of fun. There were plenty of opportunities to find and visit a character throughout the park. The lines were not too terrible (   5 mins) for most of them. Highly suggest the PhotoPass  option if you decide to do character dinings and spend time in both parks for a few days. You get all your photos from the park from the photographers, attractions, and character dinings. Well worth the price and that way you get plenty of family photos! Food was expensive at the park but we expected that. Overall, lots of fun for the family. Take advantage of going during the weekday if possible.",1
25782,"Very enjoyable trip. I wish they would open sooner. 10:00 am was just too late, especially since they closed at 8:00 pm. I also wish they would do fast passes on more rides. That is the only way we were able to get on some of the rides. In the evening while the parade was going on, we were able to go on a lot of the rides. My kids are older and didn't care to see the parade. For dinner we ate at the Plaza Inn which is on Main Street. There were six of us and I bought three chicken meals for $15.99 a piece and bought extra biscuits. The plates are filled with food and that fed all six of us. Otherwise, we didn't spend money on any other food. We brought in our own snacks. ",1
25772,"Plan for several days, or if you live local, go often. Lines can be tough, but it sure beats a day working!",1
25766,"I love Disneyland and California Adventure, so giving this a 4 is a big deal to me. Here are the problems I'm seeing: We bought 3 day passes with a  Magic Hour . That is different from Extra Magic Hour, which is for Disney Resort guests only, or Early Entry. It is very confusing and was not explained well or consistently by anyone. The food within the park is getting horrendously expensive  buy a case of water from Target, freeze some and take that with you. Getting a good place to view World of Color is a joke. We got tickets by spending $15 a person to get a lunch which came with a ticket, but those tickets don't get you anything any better than the thousands of other people who got fast passes or the lunch dinners. Try standing in the blue section on the bridge. Everyone stands up, so if you are short you are out of luck, especially if the parents put their children on their shoulders. The best thing to do? Be a VIP and get a really good seat. This is a place that can cost you big bucks between the tickets, the parking and the food. And if it ends up being a day that the rest of world decides to go, you may end up only being able to go on a couple of rides and not even going on the ones you really wanted to. Be aware that if it is a non school day, but NOT a black out day for annual passholders, it may be very crowded indeed. Some holidays that are blacked out may be less crowded.",1
25767,"Disneyland and DCA were both very busy but nothing like the summer months. My husband, 8 year old son and I enjoyed many rides and shows and the waits were usually 10 to 20 minutes maximum. There were many rides my son did not want to ride on so we did single rider and it was awesome, 5 minutes and we were on and back. Definitely a great vacation. ",1
25768,We had 2 of our granddaighters there for a birthday!  Lots for kids but not recommended for old folks who have little like of animation,1
25769,"Went on a Monday just after US school started so not busy.Longest queue time for major rides was about 15 minutes so had a great time.Having been to Disneyland in Hong Kong, I had expected the evening parade to last longer (it was about half an hour compared to 1 hour) and there was no fireworks to cap it off.Still would not miss Disneyland!",1
25770,"It's expensive, it's crowded, it's everything everyone says in these reviews, but hey, it's Disneyland!",1
25771,"Yes. It was worth travelling 13,000km for. Our kids loved every minute of our time at Disney and so did we. Our favourites were the star tours and the splash mountain. Don't miss the evening show either. Interesting to look at Small World to see just how far the park has come in 40 years. The only reason we didn't give 5 stars was that 5 rides were closed which we thought seemed a bit excessive.",1
25773,"If you have Magic Morning   would suggest you use   is great if you want to get Matterhorn, Space Tours, Space Mountain done without any waiting. We had a fantastic 3 day pass here. Was much quieter in the mornings than the afternoons. Highly recommend Star Tours, Captain Nemo and of course the Monorail. The train trip is also good fun   particularly between Tomorrowland and Main Street.",1
25781,"I may have grown into a fairly cynical 30 year old man, but Dinseyland still restores my faith in magic and storytelling. I've been on each and every ride dozens (some of them hundreds) of times, and I still notice new things. The details on the rides, line queues, and stores is still amazing, making you feel like you've stepped into another world. As I've grown older and learned how the sausage is made (and even worked for The Mouse for a brief period) and realized how crassly commercial some of the additions to the place have become, it's never broken my love of the place. A cure for cynicism that will remind you of childhood, Disneyland is a national treasure featuring a unique type of American art. Wonderful.",1
25774,A great place for all ages. Was reasonably quiet when we went so queueing was not a problem. Only thing I find is that it is hard to get healthy food inside the park but there wa quite a wait for the restaurant in Downtown Disney.,1
25775,We have recently been there for the second time and it was just as good as i remembered. The atmosphere is second to none. My advice would be to have a plan about what to do for the day. Space mountain (ghost ride) is great a little scary but amazing. We went in Septmeber and it was very hot and there were alot of people. On average we waited between 10 minutes and 40 minutes for rides.The food and drink is a little expensive but you can take water into the park which I would strongly suggest. Once inside a map is a very good idea and then I would do the popular rides first. Peter Pan is alawys busy so its best to just line up and get it over with.Overall it really is the happiest place on earth the staff are very very kind,1
25776,"Always a fun place.  Always clean and, alas, always crowded.  Just relax, smile and enjoy the other people having fun too.",1
25778,You really tour this castle & enjoy the story of Sleeping Beauty. The park is smaller so can easily do it in 1 day. Matterhorn was fun & different. The skewers at Bengal barbeque were wonderful.,1
25779,"Travelling with no children, I had not been to the park for 32 years, but was excited even as an adult to return. The ques were very long and it was very warm, thought it could have moved a bit quicker. The average wait in a line is about 1 2 hour when the park first opens. We took our time exploring the park and it lives up to all the hype. Disney is fantastic for the kids. ",1
25780,"It's been 25 years since my last visit and this time we took our young girls. We had a terrific time. September is a perfect month as the line ups are shorter, esp during the week. The park was clean, staff friendly and the rides awesome! We managed to get everything done and hopefully it won't take 25 years for us to get back. The bonus was that the park was geering up for Halloween. Fireworks and parades were spectacular and the glee and magic in the girls' eyes was beautiful.",1
25801,"I thought the park had alot to do for both children and adults, the only complain I have is that if you live far and probably will only be visiting once every so often, then you need more than a one day pass to both parks. We didnt get to get on every ride, because there were some rides that were closed or down which was disappointing. You definitly need more than one day! Everyone needs to visit!",1
25803,"If you can be there when the park opens, do it. Ride the most popular rides before the crowds get too bad. The park will get crowded and your options will narrow as the lines get longer. You might consider going back to the hotel to play in the pool or nap during the middle of the day and return refreshed for the late afternoon and evening.",1
25804,"Would definately recommend the park hopper pass for the California adventure too. Lines at Disneyland are heaps longer  saw lines with up to 90 mins waiting time. Fastpass is one way to combat that, but you can only have one at a time and when you're booking is 3 hours away that sucks. As for the rides;Pirates of the carribean  would definately not take a kid under 10  lots of skeletons, gunshots etc. havin said that there was heaps of young kids on it.Bobsled  line looks a lot longer than it is. Good ride.Snow white, mr toad, pinocchio  all the same ride. Short but cute.Splash mountain  amazing ride, but def get fastpassRocky railway  again awesome, scarier than predicted. Fastpass.Riverboat journey  don't be fooled, the line is HUGE, but it's worth up to a 20 min waitI was disappointed the disney characters weren't walking around for photos etc much. We saw them in the parade but that was about it. I went to the Aladdin place 3 times to see him and he was never there",1
25831,We enjoyed Disneyland and highly recommend it to anyone. Check out the southern California city pass for great value entry to disneyland and other theme parks in California.,1
25825,Just a wonderful place to take the family. Always fun. Always something new to look forward to. Food is good. All cast members are friendly. Get there early. We are always at the front of the gate before opening. We get a least an hour to hit all all the rides with no line. It's awesome!,1
25826,"My wife and I both grew up visiting Disneyland and watched it develop into the tourist complex that it is today. We visit about six to eight times a year, as we have an annual pass which makes the cost bearable, even economical for an afternoon's entertainment. As locals, the experience is different for us than those who travel to Anaheim for the purpose of seeing the resort. Since we are past bringing children to the park with us, we are not concerned with amenities that are important to parents. When we visit, it is more casual and we typically will only stay a few hours. After over fifty years of visiting Disneyland, I can safely say that despite all claims to the contrary, there are no secrets, tips or tricks to avoid the inevitable. You will wait in line, you will be charged more for food etc. than you expect and you will be tired at the end of the day.My most recent visit, just a couple of days ago fell in line with most of the others. Crowds were light and wait times were five minutes or less on most of the attractions with the more popular venues taking around thirty minutes. If your intent is to vacation here during peak season, it is not uncommon to wait hours for popular rides that last only a couple of minutes   it's just the way things are. Disneyland uses fast pass tickets that are issued for certain attractions to limit actually standing in line (they would prefer that you are out spending money), but we noticed that even fast pass distribution centers associated with popular rides create a line themselves, and sometimes run out before all those seeking a pass can get one.Crowds fluctuate during parade times, meal times and near opening and closing hours; but nothing is certain. Weather, days of the week and other competing activities in the area can cause crowds patterns to shift. As a rule, we never visit on a weekend, never during summer recess or during a holiday season. Exactly when most vacationers are planning on making the trip. If you are confined to peak dates and times for your visit, do yourself a favor and plan well. In all our visits to Disneyland we have never been treated poorly by a cast member, in general they will do their best to assist you within their means. The crowds, on the other hand; can take lots of patience near the middle of the day, and certainly later in the afternoon when kids and parents are tired. A little planning can go a long way.We discovered that working from the back to the front can avoid some traffic, but eventually during peak times the volume of people is nearly body to body. During these times, you may want to consider taking time out. Perhaps hitting the pool back at the hotel or a nap, with plans to return to the park later. You will have a good time if you let yourself get caught up in the spirit of the day. Disney studios is genius at make believe and if you can muster the patience to deal with the expense and the others around you (who are probably working hard to have a good time too) you will come away with a great memory. If you are lucky enough to have early access to into Disneyland which may be available if you are staying in one of the Disney hotels, then spend that time wisely. Buy a pair of ears, get a T shirt and enjoy yourself   forget the small stuff.Be patient, take time to relax and plan to spread your visit over several days if possible. We decided that park operating hours are set so to be less than necessary to see all the attractions (or even most of the attractions) in one day. Be OK with that and choose what you think is most important to you.Staying on the Disney property is a few bucks more than the surrounding name hotels, but I think it's worth it. Even as locals we will take a room at one of the Disney hotels to enjoy ourselves without being concerned about a freeway ride home at the end of the day.When I visited Disney World the last time, I had an internal clock nagging me to try to do more than reasonable because of all the resources I had put forward just to get there. Looking back, I probably was more caught up in this than was necessary. We still had a good time, but I was checking things off instead of just being in the moment. My recommendation for Disneyland visitors is to be ready to do less than you had hoped for, but have a better time enjoying what you are able to experience.",1
25827,"The best thing is that I was there on a Friday morning, so the lines were very quick and the crowds were small. After 5 there was a very noticeable increase on the amount of people in the park.Indiana Jones ride was closed for maintenance, so we missed it. Disneyland has always been a pleasure to visit. A bit steep on the prices of food and beverages compared to the outside world (bottled water costs double) so be prepared and take your own lunch or plan your spending well, or you could end up spending a lot on refreshments.",1
25828,Always a great time. The fireworks are so beautiful and really make our visits magical....just like when I was a child,1
25829,"Our group spent a whole day to visit Disneyland but we still couldn't go all remarkable destinations. So many places to go , so beautiful and amazing: Mickey Mouse, Castle, especially you had to go Indiana Jones Adventure. Services there are good, food is good, ect. Absolutely i will come back to travel the rest parts that i didnt have time to go.",1
25830,"Liked: Everything! Especially the Churro!  Disliked: The Price :( Well, you get what you pay for I suppose.",1
25832,"Maybe it's only embarassing myself that me being a 'normal' twenty something young married guy loves going Disney but I guess it is what it is. My wife and I have had season passes for the last few years and will use a trip to Disney as a time to get away or just spend the day or evening with friends. It's busy and crowded, in fact the only time it isn't busy is....who am I kidding, it's always busy and crowded. I honestly believe a big reason why I enjoy it so much is that A. I don't have kids and B. I have a season pass so I don't feel the urge to get EVERYTHING done in one day. If that was the case I can definitely see how going to Disneyland can be more of a chore than a fun day. Going on Pirates of the Carribean, Indiana Jones and Space Mountain are definite must do's but as cheesy as it sounds, pin trading is another fun activity in between rides. Restaurants are decent, but very expensive. I'd recommend eating in California Adventure or bringing your own sack lunch. All in all, it may not be the happiest place on earth for everyone, but it ranks pretty high on my list!",1
25823,Disneyland is such a magical place that you MUST experience for yourself!  It is fun for all ages and definitely one of the highlights of my year!  I am officially a Disneyland addict!,1
25833,"Yes, it's hot, packed, not the happiest place on earth, but the rides are great and the place is clean.",1
25834,The restaurant is very spendy ($25 35) a plate but worth it! Atmosphere is terrific! To make it more affordable you should split meals (portions a large).,1
25835,"Eating at the Blue Bayou restaurant adjacent to the Pirates of the Caribbean ride made my whole trip! The food was amazing. Get there at 11:30 and you'll be seated right away, even without a reservation. Reservations recommended otherwise. The restaurant tries very hard to accommodate food issues. They have GF rolls, and can make the crab cakes GF if given 45 minutes advance notice. If you don't know what you want to eat, order the famous Monte Cristo sandwich. It's absolutely to DIE FOR. So worth the calories.",1
25836,"First time at dineyland, had 2 day hopper pass and covered most of the park.Went on all rides that took me back to my childhood and enjoyed all of them,star tours a must.",1
25837,"This is my 4th visit to Disneyland and it just keeps on getting better and better! There is not one little detail missed to enhance your experience...I had stew in a bread bowl and the pieces of bread that were removed were placed at the top so it looked like Mickey Mouse! Every character does more than their best and the princesses are superlative! We treated my 4 year old granddaughter to the Bippity Boppity Boutique and it was worth every penny! World of Color, Fantasmic!, and the parade were well worth the wait. California Adventure is wonderful too! The Tower of Terror is a great ride and again, the attention to detail is amazing! The new Carsland is also fabulous and the Racers ride was well worth the 2 hour wait! Can hardly wait to go again!",1
25839,Our daughter had a great time in Disneyland. Took pictures with all the characters including the princesses. The parades where excellent. We'll return soon.,1
25824,"I have been to adventure parks in sentosa(Singapore) and Dubai.. But i think this is one of best and must see.. Don't miss the Colors show. I took a hop in ticket for both parks and every ride attraction is great. Don't miss: pirates, Mickey house,future rides...",1
25822,A great fun place but I think Florida Disney is better. We got a one day hooper ticket that allowed us to leave one park and move into the other. There are plenty of hotels within walking distance so not far to go when you have worn yourself out.,1
25805,"My husband and I took his 2 youngest kids for their first time, ages 8 and 10. Disney, as expected has lots to see and do in the park itself. The kids were never bored, and because we went on Monday and Tuesday, the lines were short and we got to ride everything multiple times. All of the employees that we spoke to were very helpful and happy, as it should be. Over the last 35 years I have been to Disneyland, too many times to count, and the experience never gets old.",1
25812,"It was a last minute decision to go to Disneyland for the evening. We wanted to see the fireworks and go on a few rides. Surprisingly, Disneyland is great for evening fun, as well as during the day. The fireworks show was awesome and the rides were obviously fun, too. Definitely use the fastpass, because you can save a lot of time doing other things while waiting to return with fastpass.",1
25806,"Of course the historical part of the park was great for me, awesome as always for Disney. I took the Walk in Walt Disneys Disneyland Footsteps tour and it was amazing, we got to go into Walts apartment! I loved seeing this park and what was changed in Florida I want to go back already!",1
25807,"with every visit the entertainment factor at disneyland is better by a mile, fantasia display, parades, firework shows",1
25808,"I went to a wedding in the area therefore we decided to spend a day using the park hopper to visit Disneyland and California Adventure. I do highly recommend getting the park hopper to visit both parks in 1 day and was well worth it. We visited middle in the summer so crowds were crazy! however what I learned is invaluable. You can get what they call  Fastpass  (Lines at Disney World can reach 2 and 3 hours long. Instead of standing in line, now you can just grab a ticket with a return time on it and you get to go right to the almost front of the line) The lesson I learned here is that they run out! and you can only get one every hour (you scan your entry ticket and that is how they keep track.. so don   t lose your entry ticket). So I would suggest planning your day just a little and try to get the most popular ride first before they run out of the FastPass, then throughout the day pick up a few more. And here is my favorite part. About half the lines have singles lines. The wait for these are about half if not less than the regular line. However you ride as a single person filling up the empty seats as needed. We honestly did not care. We had so much fun talking in line that by the time we got on the ride which only lasts a few minutes it did not matter who was sitting next to us. We knocked out about 90% of the Disneyland park & Californian adventure by doing this. Plus we were lazy and did not start the day till about 11am. Don   t forget to watch the World of Color light show at California Adventure. Amazing!! You can also get tickets for better viewing. Not sure how as we just stood in the back and had no issues. Hope you Enjoy your visit as much as we did!",1
25809,"I started going to Disneyland almost before I could walk  literally, my family lived less than 3 miles from the iconic resort. I grew up thinking all kids had parks like this in their backyards! Unfortunately, I found that to be not true when my family moved away from the SoCal area when I was 12, leaving me longing for Mickey and the Gang. I continued the trek, though, almost yearly (thankfully, grandparents remained in the area!)I met my Prince Charming, and once verifying that he, too, was a Disney holic, we wed! For 25 years, Disneyland has been our go to vacation! When we need to de stress and laugh   D land here we come! We own Mickey ears, t shirts, purses, cell phone covers, antenna ears, beach towels and more. We are proud to flaunt our Disney ism! There is no  rating  I can give Disneyland  it would be like trying to judge the American Flag....or the Smithsonian...or the beach! It is an institution, and people either love it or ....like it. So, go..because you know you want to   and it is okay to love it!",1
25810,"We had a fantastic time at Disneyland during their half marathon weekend. The organization Run Disney puts into their marathon weekends is nothing short of remarkable. Everything ran smoothly, from picking up the packets, to getting to the start line to seeing the runners at the finish line. As it is in Walt Disney World, the parks are impeccably clean, the cast is incredibly well trained and the attractions rides are well kept up. The new CARS land is wonderful and the rides are really great. The main ride in cars land is even better than Test Track for those of you who have been on it at WDW, but it has more thrills and a fabulous finish. Wont give away the surprises.After the 5K and the half marathon, the runners enjoy the park. The only drawback was that on labor day weekend it was very crowded. But, having said that, we got on all the rides we wanted to go on with minimal waits.",1
25811,"Always kept amazingly clean, lots of ride and entertaining things for all ages. It would be nice to have cooling stations though like they have at Universal. It was over 100 each day we were there.",1
25813,"I'm a frequent Walt Disney World visitor. However this was my first trip to Disneyland.  The park is easy to navigate and many of the attractions are familiar.  However, there are also some unique attractions.",1
25821,"Have any empty day or weekend and want to do something fun? Go to Disneyland!!!!! It is so much fun for all ages all the time!!!!! Highly recommended! Best Rides: Indiana Jones, Matterhorn's, SPACE MOUNTAIN, Thunder Mtn. RR, and Small World. Best ride over all I would have to say Pirates of the Caribbean!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
25814,"The original and still wonderful...if you like theme parks. I'm not all that keen on it because it's so expensive, but going with the 4 y.o. granddaughter was a ball. When you go, don't just rush from ride to ride. Take time to take in the flowers and trees. The park is replanted constantly to look its best and the landscaping is beautiful. Also, it's a great place to people watch, especially the kids. The parents can often look a bit haggard and pooped out, but the kids can go on forever!",1
25815,try to go to park Tuesday Thursday. Not as crowded. We didn't wait more than 5 mins for any of the rides.,1
25816,"What can I say other then my title? We love Disneyland! It is the happiest place on earth and I look forward to our annual trip! Use the Fastpass system, take advantage of the  Rider switch off  if you have small children (one parent waits with child and when the parent on the ride is done they switch), use the single rider option if possible it will save A LOT of time. Yes they have an off season but it still is busy, so make a plan and tackle it with some speed so you don't miss anything!",1
25817,"I have been to Disneyland 5 times over the past 25 years. On the second last trip Toontown was being built, on this trip many years later, a whole new Disney Adventure and Downtown Disney areas were constructed and well under way being enjoyed by throngs over time. As my partner and I both had happy memories of being at Disneyland before, we decided to concentrate our day on the original Disneyland Park.  I had done my homework before we left home to reacquaint myself with the layout and in the process found out about Fastpasses and all the other things that have changed (such as getting there early and running for rides   not!), battle strategies for how to get through the day etc. Well, as we were not shlepping smalls with us, none of this applied. I'm pretty grateful for that because we went during what we were told was one of the busiest weeks of the year   and it showed. Thousands of people and thousands of prams, all well parked in huge numbers outside the various attractions, eateries etc. I really felt sorry for anyone having to push a pram through the crowds that day. The walking was a dodging shuffle   I was exhausted, I can only imagine how well they would sleep after a day like that!Of course, it's Disneyland   they do it well   everything is happy and shiny. Things run well, there's plenty of everything: things to look at, rides, food, restrooms, seats. The lines for some of the more popular rides looked horrendous and were long but lines move and at the end of the day everyone gets through so it can't be all bad. Just depends what your tolerance for a queue is, I guess.The changes I noticed: some favourites were gone: the critter theatre and the theatre in the round where the filming was 360 degrees. Simple but effective. Obviously not a crowd pleaser any more with the advance of technology! Surprisingly and speaking about technology, Disney has chosen to keep its animaltronics (Abe Lincoln theatre, Tom Sawyer Island animals and indian village etc) where the technology now looks awkward and clunky. I'm sure it would be enough to thrill an under 5 though so perhaps it's kept for a less critical age group!Another change, the stores... I remember the stores in the various territories as being different and showcasing if not selling a range of items from that area of interest (ie Frontierland and plenty of native american made goods being on offer). It seems now there are a lot more stores all selling the same glitzy, cheapish disney promotions. In other words the sell seems more about Disney products than showcasing the 'lands'. Sad.Changes still: the beignets that were round, sugery and eggy are now three flat chewy sad mickey mouse shaped things with powdered suger sort of on them. And there seem to be a lot more plastic (fences, seats etc) than I remember.It isn't what I remember and I won't be going back again having been so many times now but all in all, it is Disneyland and you will have a good time regardless of when you visit. That is what the aim is and they will deliver a high percentage of happiness.",1
25818,"Loved it all. Favorite ride was Nemo submarine.  Staff was so helpful and kind! Rented a stroller, very convenient.",1
25820,Always a classic time and a place to bring back childhood memories! Fun even for adults. I came with 3. We did CA adventure too and hopped back and forth. Managed to do both parks in 1 day and hit 19 attractions. (8am 10pm). It's possible if you time it right and use fast passes. Go to the most popular attractions earliest and first.,1
25920,Disneyland the Happiest place on Earth! I love everything about Disneyland! It is a bit pricey but so worth it. I am an Annual Pass owner and I love going there everytime!,1
25922,"It's great. You know it, I know it, kids know it. Regular improvements to well known rides, new additions to famous areas, and decent prices for locals.",1
26085,"We had been to Disney World in Orlando numerous times, and we thought we would check out Disneyland and California for something different. We had heard from numerous people that Disneyland is so much smaller, and how Disney World is soooo much better, so we didn't go into it expecting very much. We were amazed and pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail there was throughout the park. Our first day, we kept comparing Disney land vs World, but by the 2nd day we stopped because things were just different, and you couldn't compare the two. We had a wonderful time, and enjoyed the rides that were new to us. Some of our favorites were Finding Nemo, The Matterhorn, and Indiana Jones.",1
26003,"Being in Cypress allows to be 10 minutes from Downtown Disney, DIsneyland, Disney California, and on the other side be the same time away from Long Beach with Queen Mary and the Beach just so close.",1
26024,We decided to travel to Disneyland with our camping units this summer as that is the best time to go without taking the kids out of school. We had a 5 day pass and most days went in the morning by opening time which meant we were parked in the lot by 7:15 am. Early but worth it. Most rides were not busy and you could get on them right away. We had lunch early  11 11:30 am  then a couple more rides (some we did have fast passes for) and left most times early afternoon when it got quite busy and hotter. Then we went back to Orangeland RV Resort (closeby) and into the pool. There were 8 children and 6 adults and we enjoyed this arrangement a lot. I would also say that I thought it would be busier but definitely going in the mornings early made a big difference.,1
26025,"What a great trip my nine yr old and I had to Disneyland in CA in early August. Weather was a little hot and humid for many, but a nice break from our 14 days of 95  in July! :) AND a really nice worker from California Adventure walked our way home the first evening and asked us how our day went. We explained that Goldie loves Disney AND beignets at Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. She let us in on a little surprise that right near Pirates of the Caribbean there is a little French Cafe that has MICKEY MOUSE shaped beignets!!!! What a great day!!!!! All of the Disney employees were as nice and helpful as ever!",1
26026,"We visted for our Daughter's 2nd Birthday! It was the best! Loved it had lots of fun!If you visit Disney California Adventure eat at Ariel's Grotto it was simply lovely. The food was of high quality. The princessess all come out! At Disneyland best place to eat is Blue Bayou again food of high quality. Chicken was really juicy and tender, they give you a big piece of steak and its so tender and delish! For 2 adults and a toddler it came out to $100, but the food and ambience was well worth it! The best way to see characters is at the character dining restaurants. We bought lots of souveniers,ya we spent a bit of money on souveniers but you only go once! You worked all year for it...",1
26027,"... this was our codeword for visiting Disneyland as it was a surprise for our youngest daughter. It's a nice place to visit at least once in your lifetime, but it has become extremely expensive lately. Many of the rides haven't been updated in a while and they seem to take you through even faster   disappointing after a 40 min wait. As opposed to Orlando's Disneyworld parks, there aren't a lot of fastpass options (just a handful), so you'll have to spend hours in line. A few tips:  Discounted tickets are sometimes sold for cash only at Anaheim hotels ($80 $72 vs. $87 $81 online @ Disney). You can also try AAA rates which are also a little cheaper.  If you've seen them before or your kids don't care much about them, skip the rides closest to the entrance (e.g., Snow White, etc.). They are *always* crowded and much less enjoyable than others (e.g., Buzz Lightyear, Roger Rabbit, etc.).  If you have a young one who really needs to get her his autographs and pictures with princesses, note that they switch every 45 min between  Ariel, Belle, Tiana  and  Aurora, Snow White, Cinderella . So if you go for a 1 hr. long line you may not end up getting the pictures with the princesses you see then   ask the staff when is the next switch and, if needed, wait until your favorites arrive. Merida and Rapunzel have separate lines and we weren't able to find Jasmine. (Yes, we spent almost 3 hours in lines, but now are the proud owners of all eight priceless autographs pics).   It's a small world  ride was updated since I last saw it (2008) and as always, gives the young and old a good feeling (albeit far from really reflecting the real world   but we're not there for that, right?). Jungle cruise, Splash Mountain, and most of the other pre teen teen rides had long lines all day, so we skipped most. The teacups had very short wait times all day, and so did Gadget's Go Coaster.   You can check lines wait times using iPhone or Android apps on your phone   esp. helpful if you have people ranging in interests in your party. ",1
26028,We traveled to California to visit relatives and had no intentions of going to Disneyland. I AM SO GLAD WE CHANGED OUR MINDS!!! We had an excellent time. We arrived about 1pm and stayed until the park closed at midnight. We went on a weekday; the park was crowded but very manageable. We parked in the parking garage ($15) but well worth it for the tram ride and the feeling of safety for us and our small children. A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!!,1
26029,Loved the Fast Pass and patriotic decorations. Even had the Star Spangled Banner play at 5pm when taking down our flag.,1
26030,"had great fun....really clean, lots to do and see for all ages...food and drink pricey, but excellent otherwise",1
26031,"Had my first Disney experience this year   wow. I could not get over the cleanliness of the park, the quality of the attraction, the food vendors and above all, the kindness of the staff and patrons of the park. I lost my wallet with my credit card in it   went back hours later to search. The staff were so sympathetic to my loss that they let me back into the park to search where I had been that day   no luck. When I returned to the main gate I spoke to a staff member and she handed me my wallet   it had been turned in by a kind patron. How great was that? Great experience",1
26032,Awesome place to be and visit. Visited DisneyWorld Orlando 2 times and this was our 1st time in Disneyland. Not much difference between the two except that it's not as hot as FL which makes the day more enjoyable. My wife and I love Disney just as much if not more than the kids. Our family's favorite attraction is Splash Mountain...we go at least 5 times on that ride when we visit Disney. Take advantage of Fast Pass as early as possible for your favorite rides! Can't wait for the next family vacation to Disney.,1
26033," As a little girl I always dreamed of going to Disneyland. Unfortunately my family was never financially stable enough to be able to make that journey so it was completely magical and amazing for me to be able to (at age 32) take my two children (ages 12 and 5) to Disneyland.  My husband, kids, and I had a completely amazing time. Despite some blisters and a crazy amount of walking (we learned after a day how to map out our game plan and ride route) it was the most fantastic vacation we've been on. Disney really does put a lot of the money you spend back into their parks. You can tell via the quality of the shows, rides, performers, and scenery that they work really hard to make Disney as wonderful as you'd imagine.  I would say my only complaint is I imagined Disney costumed characters walking around all over the place so kids could get copious amounts of autographs and things. There were more characters seen in California Adventure than in Disneyland (and in Disney to meet  Princesses  you have to stand in line for a  Princess Walk ).  Utilize the fast pass and come up with a good game plan and you shouldn't have to do a ton of waiting (we were even there during busy season and the longest we waited was about 30 minutes for a ride with an average of about 10 15 minutes). ",1
26034,So clean so friendly just a joy to be part of the Disney experience? So many push chairs around with parking  near by to all the attractionsp,1
26036,"I had been here 17yrs ago and now I brought my family. So much better than before. The old attractions are still great and the new ones too. This trip was for my daughter and we were not disappointed. Good to see Captain Eo back in action...though a bit dated. The healthy food choices were good as well. Had some trouble with Splash Mountain both days and was stuck on the ride and had to exit, but we were taken care of with additional front of the line passes. Matterhorn was closed for upgrades as it was 17 years ago so I still have not ridden....that was unfortunate. tried to exchange some Canadian money which was trading at .98 cents on the US dollar and the rate we were offered by Disney was .77cents",1
26037,"Spent 2 days at Disneyland, awesome place to see and visit. We were here in the second week of August and it's pretty crowded, people were basically everywhere. If you don't like crowds, don't come here. Must see's are the Main Street Parade, Fireworks and the Fantasmic show. But for these you have to line up about a hour before to get the best viewing spots. Rides were very good but the lineups were around 45min to an hour. Fast Pass is the way to go on the rides that offer them or go on as a single rider which my daught did on most of them. Kids liked Space Mountain but for me it was a bit much. Not really into hi speed roller coaster rides in the dark. Kids wanted autographs of all the characters but they are really hard to get. With temperatures around 98F they didn't stay out very long and you can't blame them, especially what they had to wear. The park is very clean and we had a good time. Just be warned that it is very expensive once inside the park for food, drinks, souveniers etc.",1
26038,Had a complete blast with my family this summer at disneyland park. Other than the clear days with the addition of heat our trip couldn't have went any better.  Thank you!,1
26039,"no one at Disneyland acts out, is hostile or threatening. Everybody is in their best behavior    kids of course somewhat excepted. The more I go the more I appreciate Disneyland, the facilities are as well maintained as can be expected. The Aladdin show, by the way, is as good as you'll find anywhere.",1
26023,Such a great family vacation! Park was not crowded. Loved the new parts of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Such great memories made once again.,1
26022,"A Midweek hot August day is the perfect time to re visit!!Crowds seem to shrink with the heat, but the queues take just as much time!!Disney is always predictable with the organisation and service with a smile. We quite enjoyed the FastPass feature of the tickets, however times were going into the night. Not much has changed since we last visited 7 years ago, good as in predictable, bad as in the kids got bored quickly.Food and drink is at a premium, just like any other park!!",1
26021,"It was a perfect way to start vacation on the west coast US, we stayed around for 2 days and with every hour we spend it became a memory. We have been to disney in Paris before but to come here was even more cherished stay as it was more classic. Also, the places around like shopping at Outlets added to the much needed break from dream world!!",1
26012,"I was on a business trip, but thought I could not go to Anaheim and not visit Diisneyland.  I enjoyed my day. The New Orleans Quarter was my favourite bit   great jazz around lunch time.",1
26005,"Everything we'd hoped it would be! Loved the shows, mild but wild rides and the coming together of the film experience with theme park.",1
26007,"This is to me one of the seven wonders of the world. I can not wait until my grandchildren are old enough to really enjoy the place. I will be taking them for sure. I find the food is quite expensive in the park so I choose not to eat there. I found that when the afternoon parade was on was a really good time to join the quite short queues for some of the attractions. Some of them we never had to wait   just got in and straight on. Splash Mountain we were able to ride twice in a row without having to get off at all!! Love everything about this place and have quite an addiction to it having been here in 1979, 1994,2001,2010 and 2012.",1
26008,"Had fantastic 2 days at Disneyland and California Adventure! The new Carsland was great! Looks like you're walking into the movie. If you want to beat the line for the Racer ride, be there when the park opens and go straight to the ride. We were on the ride in 15 minutes. After we got off, we then got Fastpasses and went again later in the day. World of Color show was amazing! Don't miss it!",1
26009,Always enjoy Disneyland with the family. Lines were much shorter since the Ca. Adv Cars land opened this year.,1
26010,Rides for every age. My grandson loved starwars and really thought he was flying in space. Fireworks were fantastic at night.,1
26011,"We have just returned from Disneyland for the third time. It's still excellent but we mainly went to check out the new cars land, on our way to Vegas. The wait for all rides was incredible. (school holidays) The main cars ride wait was at least 3 hours. I also lined up for the fast pass at 8.00am and by the time i got to the fast pass ticket booth they were all gone at 8.45am. If you have kids who reach the height requirement my advice to you is go to the SINGLE RIDERS line. Myself, my husband and my son who is 11 lined up and waited 20 minutes. We all went in cars one after another and finished the race within minutes of each other.",1
26013,"I have been to the one in Orlando more times than i can count. Now i want to go to the one in California. BTW, our favorite ride now is the Mummy!!",1
26020,Disney land Park turned out to be very bit what we had imagined...the park had everything for all ages..we went there early morning and came out at the very end...Some tips : Be sure to go early in the day 900 am should be bestBook on line and u will save some money as on line rates are lowerTake a two day both Disney and California adventure pass and spend 1.5 days at Disneyland Park ...about half a day for California adventure is fine..Be sure to visit the Little kids section regardless of ur age...This is really excellent and u will love every bit of it,1
26014,"We had fun, my family of four (2 children age 7 & 2) Everything was good, the only thing i can complain about was that they wont let you in with wagons and that the food and drinks are very expensive. The worst part is that our stroller was stolen from the stroller parking area while we were all on a ride. they should have some sort of ticketing system, when i went to the lost and found there were 3 other people that wer also missing strollers. Thats is not right.",1
26015,"If you are an adult that has never been and think that Disneyland is only for children   don't let that hold you back from visiting the happiest place on earth. Summer is very busy and lots of line ups, but if you can, go in the fall and still get nice weather and no line ups. ",1
26016,"First of all, if you have never been, or its been awhile, go to www.mousesavers.com and read on tips to visiting Disneyland. We wore our athletic shoes instead of flip flops or sandals in 96 degree heat, but we were glad we did because we were running around for 12 hours! They also explain the Fast Pass system, and by the end of our trip, we didn't wait more than 10 minutes to get on ANY ride   we just timed it better! Star Tours has a 45 minute wait? Grab a fast pass and go on something that only has a 5 minute wait. Run into a show like Captain EO to get out of the heat for a while, hey, our Fast Pass is ready to use! Lets go! We would take a break in the middle of the day, like around 2pm, and go have a big lunch out of the park, and then go back to the hotel for a nap. We closed the park down at 11 each night, and got up early to be in the park by 7:30am, so those mid afternoon naps were vital   and I'm talking about for the teenagers as well. We also ate in the park   it is not as expensive as I first feared   about what it would cost us to go to any family restaurant like Red Robin. Our average meal cost for 5 people   2 adults, a 17, 14, and 7 year old, was around $50 $60.00. The restaurants we ate at also had free refills on drinks. We tried the Pizza and Pasta Garden spot in Disney California, and found the Pizza and salads and spaghetti to be wonderful (and the servings more than we could eat) Water is expensive, and the  city water  in the drinking fountains did not taste very good, so we filled our fanny packs with bottled water and had a great time!",1
26017,"Enjoyed rides and whole experience. Favorite as always Pirates of Caribean, also new Star Tours. Not enough time to do and see all.",1
26018,"Was in America for a month. We stayed in Arizona, Phoenix, but had a trip for 3 days in California. We visited Disneyland and had a great time. If I could I would do it again it was so much fun, and everybody in the park was so funny and cheerful.",1
26019,Friends told me to save my money and go to Disney in Florida but I decided to check out Disneyland anyway. The tickets were ridiculously priced ($435 for a one day ticket for five of us) and the food is OBSCENELY priced. The rides and attractions were great. There was a light show at 9pm and it made me feel like I got my money's worth. The light show was followed by fireworks. I would go again.,1
26041,"Disneyland Resort   as it is now called is a very busy place during summer! If you like crowds and waiting more than 90 minutes for a ride or attraction   join the queue. I took my sister and 2 children aged 8 (girls) to Disneyland Resort and besides busy   it was expensive. One particular thing that was a surprise to me was the  Princess factory  in the sleeping beauty castle area. Under high pressure this 8 year girl was preped and adored by the girls at the hair and make up salon   then after the $55. price tag for that she was ushered into the  dress  department and she was so impressed that $75. (for the dress) she was dressed and adored and spoken to like a princess! All fine. When I asked my sister to pay the price her jaw dropped open with (unimpressed delight). She claimed later to my sister (who is her grandmother) that she really felt like a princess! Well, I suppose one can be forgiven for the attitude but the price nearly robbed my sisters pocket clean! She was delighted and I too was happy for her. The other 8 year old looked on in boredom and wanted another ride on a particular attraction and off we went. Then, came time for meals. Princess was highly allergic to wheat and that was where it all came unstuck. Chefs were called out, counter staff's eyes glazed over and when we stuck to water and fruit   all was well   except of course that every meal could not be fruit and water. Eventually we found the  Pizza  restaurant that had a  Gluten free  pizza! We ate there all the time. They served pasta too and that pleased everyone (nearly). However, the children were so tired out that to go another 2 hours until closing time on the new  ride attractions area  was just too much. They slept soundly each night. We had an interesting event in the New Orleans restaurant when 2 young boys left their bag and jackets behind. Security were called in   restaurant closed to all other patrons (except those currently eating there) and eventually the dog squad was brought in! When the dog finished its job   the boys returned (having remembered where they left their items) with mother in tow to reclaim their items   to the amusement of the patrons and staff, the boys rushed in to see the dog and security  handling  the items with curious looks on the mother's and boys faces! Security is taken very seriously in Disneyland. Good to see. Disneyland is a great place, it is safe, clean, welcoming, friendly, helpful, beautiful, eventful, and best of all a happy place for children (and adults). Good to see that the food standard has improved over the past 5 years.",1
26042,"we loved everything, well everything we visited...We visited both parks and we liked the disneyland park more than california adventure side...disneyland felt more like  disney  but we did enjoy the bug land, cars, ariel, ice cream and swinging gondolas on the California adventure sideWe disliked the long lines...",1
26043,"Love Disneyland!  We let our two girls loose in the park and they had a great time. It was clean, fun, and truly the happiest place on earth. I",1
26076,Be sure to get up early if you have a 3 day park hopper or longer and get there an hour early.  You can ride so many rides with 0 wait time!,1
26066,"We visited Disneyland in July and spent 7 days there. We decided to stay at the Grand Californian and used this our base and because of this we really enjoyed disneyland regardless of the crowds. As we were staying at a disneyland resort we got early morning magic, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday. On our first morning we arrived at the park at 7.00am. Note that only Tomorrowland and Fantasyland are open at 7.00am and the rest of the park and rides open at 8.00am. We managed to do 11 rides by 9.30am and then we left the park.It is important that you know how the fast pass system and single rider line works.Fast Passes are available from when the whole park opens i.e 8.00am. this early you should be able to get a fast pass every 40 mins or every hour. If you like a ride, then as you come off get a fast pass. This fast pass can be used any time after the start return date. This means that if the return time is between 9.00 10.00am then you can return any time after 9.00 until the park closes at midnight. At 9.00am you can then get another fast pass. Just check the bottom of your fast pass and it will say when you can get your next. Also be aware that Roger Rabit's Car Toon Spin is on a separate fast pass system and so you can have a fast pass for this ride as well as one for another ride in Disneyland Park at the same time. If you are at the park early get fast passes before you leave so that you can return later at night and ride your favourite rides without waiting.Single Rider works a bit different. We had problems getting on Matterhorn Bobsled as most early mornings it was not working, so one day my children lined up to ride it. Then I discovered single rider. The single rider line is near the exit to the right of the ride. My children then rode single rider 3 times and went straight on the ride with no wait. Rides we loved were Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Tours Gadget's Go Coaster,Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Haunted House, Matterhorn Bobsled and Indiana Jone Adventure.Fantasmic was a great show and so was the Soundsational Parade. The only problem with Fantasmic is that it is hard for little children to see, especially when adults push in front of younger children. They should have tiered viewing area's. The park also get very busy at night around 9.00pm.Jedi Training is a must for young children especially boys. Overall we really enjoyed disneyland by experiencing it the smart way and our longest wait time was 20 mins for the Matterhorn Bobsleds and that was mid afternoon.",1
26067,"If you grew up with Disneyland, it just doesn't matter   its still Disneyland. Sure, it's tired and crowded and hot and a little careworn on the edges   but it is still DISNEYLAND!! Even after 3 days, we rarely make it to California Adventure   we just keep going back to the 'real' Disneyland!For those who grew up in locales other than Southern California, or have seen other Disneylands   well, give the grandmother a break! The Engineers have made an art form out of waiting in line, and the Fast Pass is great!",1
26068,"My family of four has been to the Orlando parks five times, visited the Paris park, and this was our second trip to Anaheim. The park itself was as clean, friendly, and as magical as ever. Granted we went in early summer, but is imperative that you take advantage of the early morning hours and plan your use of the Fastpass system carefully if you want to ride the most popular rides. Make sure you ride Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, and Splash Mountain early in the day. The only negative we noticed was that several rides had mechanical issues during the ride, which we found extremely unusual.",1
26069,"Beautiful and magical place. Clean, good service, good restaurants and rides. I'd recommend Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion, Pirates..",1
26074,"I went with a large group of family, but split into 2 groups. This was excellent because the men in their 30s and 40s did not want to go through the Princess Castle! One of our group members was from LA, and knew how to navigate through the park. We utilized the Fast Pass option when we could. It can be a very expensive day but you can bring bottled water with you which I highly recommend. We ate lunch at the barbecue place which was served family style and quite tasty. Ribs were close to being perfect!! I was exhausted at the end of the day and had difficulty getting out of the car once we arrived to the hotel. Not a spring chicken anymore! I think it would have been fun to stay in the resort area and spend a few days there, as we were not able to visit California Adventureland next door.",1
26075,You can just be a kid again! Just plan to get there early in the day ..so you can relax and take your time and enjoy all that the park has to offer and kick back!,1
26077,"What needs to be said?  Disneyland is a very magical place, and it always makes you feel like a kid.  I can't get enough of this place.  I wish I could stay there for a night or two at least.  I love this place!",1
26064,We went to Disneyland for my Daughter's 4th Birthday and everyone there made her feel so special. She was so excited and happy to be there. All day long everyone kept giving her High 4 and telling her Happy Birthday! She thought that Disnelyand was bulit just for her.,1
26078,"Even though lots of people were streaming in, once we arrived it the park, it didn't seem that crowded. We did have to wait in some lines but we could have made better use of the Fastpass. Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean were both broken the day we were there and the times we were around. They let you bring water and food in with you which I think is very good. Seemed a little more confined than Disney in Orlando but I haven't been there in years so that could be my memory.",1
26079,As usual Disney never disappoints we had a great time even for the busy season with fast passes and good planning wait times weren't horrible at all!!,1
26080,"We go to Disney World in Florida all the time, since we are Disney Vacation Club members. Decided to give Disneyland a try. Everyone is always saying how much more Disney World has to offer, but I disagree. Disneyland is much smaller, but it has more attractions packed in to a smaller space. There are more rides compared to the Magic Kingdom in Florida. And the rides are different. Loved Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean and Space Mountain. The weather is better no extreme heat and storms when compared to Disney World. Park does seem more crowded, due to smaller spaces. Don't be fooled by smaller size you still need several days to do it all. Loved it!",1
26081,"I've lived my entire life in Orange county so Disneyland has always been a part of my life. In my 47 years on this earth I have been to Disneylandmore times than I can count. It has changed over the years, gotten very expensive and crowded, but it is still an experience not to be missed. I wouldn't think of allowing any of my children to miss the adventure.A few tips: If possible, go during the off season fall and winter. Disneyland is beautifully decorated during this time and less crowded. Avoid the holiday season as it does get crowded. If traveling during high season go when the prk first opens. In the early hours you have optimal riding time. I love to have lunch at the Golden Horseshoe in the Disneyland Park in Fontierland. Get there early already show to get a good table. It's always a comfortable temperature regardless of the season. The show is totally  hoakey  but fun and amusing. This is a nice, relaxing place to rest and reenergize before heading out for more fun. Utilize the fast pass system. Be patient and relax. It's much more fun if you don't get stressed about the crowds and the wait.",1
26082,Disneyland is incredibly service dog friendly. We took the 10 month old Golden Retriever puppy we are raising for Canine Companions for Independence. He was welcomed warmly and was a huge hit with cast members and guests alike. Disney supports several service dog organizations with the proceeds from their recyclables. There are service dog relief areas throughout the parks   Disneyland is easier than California Adventure with all the fenced in grassy areas accessible to service dogs.Wendell was able to go on many of the rides with us (everything except the roller coaster based rides.) There is an easy way to do the doggy switch off on rides like Space Mountain and Indiana Jones. Most of the cast members are well trained about service dogs and are willing to ask if they don't know. Photo opportunities abound. Wendell met and was photographed with many characters. They all loved him and spent lots of time  talking  with us about him.We had a great 4 days in the parks and stayed at the Paradise Pier and the Grand Californian.,1
26083,"The cast members were friendly as ever, the park was beautiful and clean as ever, I love what they have done with all of the upgrades in and around the park. The lines were longer than expected, and some were down for maintenance more than I would have liked. The only thing that I did not enjoy were the other tourists! ",1
26065,it feels like in a storybook !!the atmosphere as you walk between attractions is really fairytale.you can find fun for all ages,1
26062,"Could not justify paying for a Disney Hotel in the Park with four people, so we stayed a few blocks away at the Residence Inn by Marriott   there is a shuttle stop on property every 20 minutes ($8 per person per day) which was fine. We got great advice at the Hotel which was to be at the Park at least 30 minutes before it opens at 8:00 a.m. and go straight to the line for a Fast Pass for your favorite ride. Then you can go wait in line for the other rides   the lines are not bad until 10:00 to 10:30 a.m. We did 5  rides by that time. After that, expect 1 hour wait times unless you have a Fast Pass, but you can only get 1 pass per ticket on 2 hour block. We started at California Adventure and by mid afternoon we went across the plaza to Disneyland. We did every ride we wanted to do at least once in 2 days by starting early.",1
26044,I did not plan to attend California Adventure that day but with all the family together it became a reality I will never forget.,1
26051,"We may be old but we still love the parks. Very busy with quite a long wait to get on the rides, plan this part of your trip for when the schools are back in the USA.",1
26045,"My wife and I got tickets to go here on our latest trip to LA. We had gone to Disneyworld a couple of years ago, so we wanted to do Disneyland. We got there just before they opened the gates, and there were not very many people at all (Sunday). We were greeted inside the gates by Mickey, Minnie & Goofy. Luckily it was not too hot the day we went. The first ride my wife wanted to do was Pinnochios Daring Adventure (no line) which was pretty neat. The next few rides we did were Dumbo, Mad Tea Party, Mr. Toads Wild Ride & Casey Jr Circus Train, all of which had NO LINE. We also did It's A Small World, which was much bigger than the one in Orlando, and it also had NO LINE. I guess everyone else headed for other parts of the park, but it was nice to not stand in line (at least in the morning). Later on we did Winnie the Pooh (fairly short line), and also did Star Tours, Finding Nemo and Buzz Lightyear Blasters. Those 3 were very cool and we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes for each one. We did not do Space Mountain. The one at Disneyworld tossed us around so much, we did not even try it here. We did a few more rides as well.We did a few things in the California Adventure park, but were a little disappointed in the new Car's Land section. Yes, it looked nice just like the movie but it was almost a 3 hour wait for the car ride. Even the single rider line was close to 2 hours. I think we had finally figured out where everyone went : ) Oh well. We watched folks ride around for a few minutes then moved on to something else.Overall we had a great time.",1
26046,I go to Disneyland a few times a year and as I get older I enjoy the atmosphere more than the rides. I love to people watch and see the majority of the people with smiles. The wait for it being August was not bad. No where else i'd rather be.,1
26047,"Our family had an amazing to time in Disneyland.One think I would recommend is NOT to go throughing its peak season (June August). I found that if you go the first week of Septemeber you will find that is not nearly as crowded or HOT! There's nothing worse than standing in a line for 45 mins with a bunch of screaming kids, while the sun is beaming on you. Lol!",1
26048,"First time visiting Disneyland, and it was AMAZING! From the moment you step through the gates, and past the crowds of people, you will be amazed by the sights, sounds and sheer atmosphere! You can see children, families and couples all bright eyed and excited for the day ahead!You will feel like you are immersed into a whole new world, away from reality.The rides great too! With all types and intensity to suit different people. Highlights for me were the Haunted Mansion, which had awesome holographic images, and Its a Small World. When I went there it was still the holiday season, so these rides had holiday themes to it. Another ride worth taking is the Space Mountain! Its a fast paced, action ride. Even those who have a fear of roller coasters should take this ride! You won't feel nauseous or anything. The Star Wars ride was great too! Although abit short, but a great experience nonetheless.Would definitely recommend everyone to go there at least once! Although I'm sure once wouldn't be enough!",1
26049,We had a five day park hopper pass for Disneyland and California Adventure park which was a good thing. The lines are really really long and going in the summer is not something I would want to do again. Maybe October or something. We had early entry and were at the park around 7 each day. But by 2:00 the weather was way too hot and we would have to go back to the hotel pool or do some shopping in the airconditioned shops in downtown Disney.,1
26050,"I have been lucky enough to visit the park at least once a year since I was 5 (and I'm old now), and it has never let me down. I have passed on this love of the park to my kids who honestly see it as the happiest place on earth. Yes, it can get crowded, and yes it can get costly, but I don't mind paying for something that brings so much happiness to all of us.The new Cars Land is thoroughly amazing, and the folks at Disney have truly created another area that will make people look in amazement and smile for years to come.",1
26052,The big rides are thrilling but not death defying. The others are cute and nostalgic. The color of light show was amazing along with the fireworks. The shops are fun to look through; found some very unique gifts in a shop on Main Street. The only drawback is the lines between parks; should be one for bags and one for without.,1
26060,"Disneyland just keeps getting better and better! I truly believe Walt would be so proud to see how his dream continues to make so many so incredibly happy! Disney is far above any other Amusement Theme park I have ever been to! They don't cut back on anything! Everything is so clean, beautiful and extremely eye pleasing! The food is better than most sit down restaurants! We as a family have visited well over 90 times in the last 2 years. We are always learning something new on each of our visits. Their annual passes are a bit pricey but when you take into consideration all of the benefits, discounts, and annual passholders specials benefits it makes it all worth it! We love the ability to dream and watch our kids light up and truly believe that they are apart of the magic! Kids or no kids I will always enjoy the full Disney experience!!! ",1
26053,"My family goes to Disneyland at least once a year. Cars Land also just opened up at California Adventure Park, so it was also a must see. We dined at downtown Disney and came back for the nightly fireworks and World of Color show.",1
26054,The original and still the best. Reasonable line ups even though it was summer vacation season. Never felt overtly crowded. Needs to do better with cooling for people in ques and more refreshment vendors accessble to ques. (Universal knows how to do it.),1
26055,"Carsland, wowee, do not miss this part of the Disneyland Adventure Park. Once in you won't want to leave. The Mickey's ferris wheel of fear OMG, you are so close to wetting yourself, the gondola's swing and drop whilst they take you around the wheel. Super freak you out kind of ride. You can try a free chocolate at Ghiradelli's, these chocolates put Hershey's to shame. Nice food, despite being pricey. Lot's of rides, shops, places to eat and relax and clean toilets. Don't forget the Tower of Terror. It's great. As for the Disneyland Park itself, it's so cool, where else would you be able ti see a white turkey? Pet some goats, a lamb and horses, whilst taking a break from the rides, or just get into the heart of canoeing? If that wasn't enough, go on Space Mountain, you be amazed at how they move the tracks for the disabled riders car. The only spoiler to the this place was the queue jackers, yep, the one person waiting in line and then ten of their guests jump in line. Disney has got to stop this before someone loses their temper badly. When you see the fireworks, man does it pull on the heart strings and give you a lump in your throat. Forget the people telling you only need a few days to do these parks, we had 5 days and this was not enough to do everything as well as see all the shows, parades and fireworks. If don't like the food on offer, you get literally walk across the road from the park and eat at many of the restaurants on Harbour Boulevard to go down to Katella and eat there. Having been to Walt Disney World and Disneyland Paris, each have their own uniqueness, the original is definitely the best and well served by both local transportation and shuttle buses. The magic really lives on. Make use of the single rider options to get the best out getting on the more popular rides.",1
26056,"We just got back from a five night stay as Disneyland. What really needs to be said about D land. I love it but I am a 40 year old big kid. We went with our three kids (4, 8 & 15) and my mother in law. We had a fabulous trip. It was very crowded, which seems common, while we were there. Disneyland is expensive and they know that you will spend the money because it   s for your kids. But with the cost being somewhat high you get a very safe, clean and classical experience. Save money be bringing water in the park but its hard not to just splurge why you are Disneyland. Notice I did use  family trip  instead of  vacation  because while it is lots of fun its very exhausting. The heat, people, lines, kids getting tired and the long days make for a very busy trip. Not a relaxing vacation but priceless memories I will have with my kids to last a long time. I can   t wait to go again but I have to save first!!",1
26057,We visited with 5 adults and 1 child. As an adult what really catches my eye is the attention to detail they give most everything. Even waiting in line I was entertained with all the little touches the put on everything. The food was pricey and selection was limited but what they offered was good. We spent all day here and had a great time from age 8 to 62!,1
26058,"We visited Disneyland on August 8 2012. Due to the fact that we stayed at Grand California we were able to enter the park early at 7am. We got in line right away for Radiator Spring Racer and waited about 20 min. The ride was well worth the wait. We've been coming to Disneyland for about 30 years now and it's gotten better and better. The service is great, there are always so many attendants on the rides to help you. (Go over the Knott's and you will see the difference.) However the ticket price has also gotten higher and higher. Be prepared to pay good money for food too...but it's a must for us to have churros and frozen lemonade at Disneyland. We ate at Pizza Port in Tomorrow Land and the food was delicious. Afternoon time gets really hot at Disneyland so we went back to the hotel to rest. Comes evening the weather really cools down so we went back to the park and stayed until closing time.",1
26004,"The best place to take your family. Young, old, bring 'em all. it truly is my happiest place on earth. I will be back every chance I get.",1
26002,"I took my daughter early in August, 2012. We spent an entire day at Disneyland, from opening to closing and had an absolute blast. The grounds are beautiful, the staff we met were all friendly. We went on almost everything, from Dumbo's Flying Elephants to Space Tours. Our favs were Space Tours, Buzz Lightyear's Blasters, Big Thunder Railway, Pirates, Autopia, Indiana Jones and the Matterhorn. Be aware that some areas close down during the fireworks but you can see the fireworks from pretty much everywhere. We can't wait to go again!",1
25923,"Love Disneyland and California Adventure!!  The parks are always fun,  the cast members are very informative",1
26001,"My husband and I recently spent 5 days at Disneyland California Adventure and it was everything we hoped it would be and more. We are both just overgrown kids... we spent the first day running all over the park, riding everything we could and just grinning from ear to ear. We were there Thursday   Monday... the first 4 days were not bad at all. Sure there were crowds but by getting there early in the morning we were able to ride popular non fast pass rides, use fast passes for the big rides and using a smart phone app to see what wait times were. Monday was really busy; difficult to get around, lines were twice as long as they had been the previous 4 days and fast pass times were way too late in the evening for us since we had to catch an early shuttle back to the airport, and the level of rudeness of others was unbelievable. Nothing like the first 4 days where everyone seemed pleasant, happy to be there making for a really magical and wonderful experience. But, I think over the course of the time we were there, between the 2 parks we must have done close to 90 rides. Here is what I would recommend to anyone thinking of going...1. Do your research. I knew what food each of the restaurants served and the cost so we were able to eat very well without breaking the bank. 2. Go to the Mint Julip bar for Disney's non alcoholic mint julip and Micky shaped beignets. 3. If you can get there right when they open, head for Peter Pan before it gets to busy. We were able to average close to 10 rides in the first 2 hours. 4. Use fast passes when available. These really cut down on wait time for the big attractions and we were able to do a ton of rides while waiting for our times5. Take breaks  it is ok to go back to the hotel and rest, go shopping, eat outside the parks. Getting there when they open and staying until they close still leaves you with plenty of time to ride everything you want to.6. If you have a smart phone, get the Disney park app. It gives you wait times for the standby lines and the times that the fast passes will be good for. Overall, if you are a kid at heart of any age, you must go. My husband and I can   t wait to come back again!!!",1
25942,"Just came back spending 4 days at Disney parks in LA. The thing about Disney is the more time you spend there, the more you think you can do...even after 4 days, we felt there is so much more we could have done.Really enjoyed the new Carsland rides, especially the Radiator Springs, lucky to do that twice given that typical waiting time for that one is about 2 hours. Among the favorite rides in CAP   Tower of horror, Radiator springs, Mickey's giant wheel, California screaming roller coaster, soaring over California, Grizzly river (and I'm sure I missed few). In Disneyland park, almost everything is great...The most favorite part was World of Colors and Aladdin in California adventure and Fireworks, Fantasmic in Disneyland park...simply awesome...",1
25943,"Attendants very, very helpful.  Place is extremely clean and well kept.  Lots of shade to rest and watch the crowds.  Rides are so much fun.  Best of all is the newest Radiator Springs Cars   best ride!!! Don't miss it!!",1
25944,"The Magic never leaves   have been at least 20 times in my lifetime and although rather tiring (due to the heat), well worth the time. I do think the ticket prices have got to be a bit ridiculous though!",1
25945,"I had a blast during my two day visit to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure this past April. I have been to Disney World many many times and was very excited to finally get the chance to see the park that started it all.Disneyland met every expectation I had: While much smaller than its sister park in Orlando it still has plenty of attractions and a certain charm that I can't quite put into words. Instead of being disappointed by how small the Disneyland complex is, I was thrilled at the idea of being able to  park hop  so easily   no shuttle buses needed, just a short walk from one park to the next. I cannot wait to go back there again! ",1
25947,"First time back at Disneyland in 13 years and it's just as wonderful as always. Disney sets the standard when it comes to amusement parks. It's the atmospere and shows that set it apart from everywhere else. If you have been, you know what I mean.If you haven't seen them, do yourself a favour and stay late to watch the fireworks and the Fantasmic show. They do these every night! It's not cheap but it is obvious that they do put the money back into the product. Can't wait to go back!",1
25948,If only every business was run as well as Disney!  Great service and attractions!  Great for all ages!,1
25950,"No better place for four year olds on Earth.  Lines were short the last week of August  perhaps because school just started and nobody takes days off during the first week of school?  Most rides were 5 minutes, worst was 25 min.",1
25951,There is nothing that we don't love about Disneyland!  It is a great place to visit over and over!  The park is fun and clean.  The rides and shopping are amazing!,1
25952,highly recommend a 3day pass to fully experience everything. We bought the citypass from entertainment.com for $255. Worth the money!,1
25953,My wife and I visit have yearly passes and we walk around the park just to people watch. We also love the old fashion corn dog's.,1
25954,"I am a Disney Nut. My dreams of a Disney Park experience were dead on with real life. I visited as a 22 year old for the first time with my boyfriend and we had a simply amazing trip. We visited in late August and had our pick of the rides early in the morning and as the day went on saw lines grow a little bit, we never really had to wait. The one line we did wait in was from Matterhorn, it had been down our entire trip and the last day we got to ride it once. I was disappointed that I only was able to ride the Haunted Mansion once, it went into seasonal refurbishment mode after our first day for Halloween. I would recommend Disneyland for any age group, as an adult I know I appreciated it much more than I would have as a child. You can almost feel Disney's presence in the park, the staff ensure his memory is well served by providing the best service in the world. I cannot wait to go back.",1
25955,"I have lived in SoCal my whole life and by far the best place to visit is Disneyland. Wear good shoes, bring your own water snacks or you will be stuck paying $4 for a water! Tickets are expensive however we have Season passes which are the best since you pretty much pay for your passes with just making one trip a month to the park.  )",1
25956,"So it isn't quite as big as Disney World and they do not have quiet as many parks but, we still love coming here. The best part (typically) is the weather. This year was not the norm... it was HOT. Usually isn't nearly as hot here as it is in Florida and you don't have to spend your entire vacation taking a rain coat on and off. ",1
25957,"Disneyland is for everyone from 5 years old to 70. I sometimes think the 70 year olds have more fun then the 5 year olds. The old people actually remember Walt Disney and when the Walt Disney show and when he talked about opening this great place. The 5 year olds are almost too young to get dragged around the place but it is a right of passage and it happens until they get older and really enjoy it. There are great rides including one that inspired a movie, shows constantly and food from all around the planet. This place is great. Have a good time and remember your youth.",1
25958,"Disney is Disney!  Fun, busy, tiring and unforgettable.  Parks open 8 midnight which you need to get round everything.  Can be done in a day but you probably won't get to do everything in peak season.",1
25941,"I went several times to WDW in Orlando, that was my 1st trip to California. There was long (very very) wait lines, not enough water fountains, not enough shaded areas and the food was atrocious (it is also in Florida). WDW in Orlando is bigger, better flow of air, more A C and is better  organized  in general.",1
25940,the most magical place ever! loved everything just a bit crowded at times but hey its disneyland. try and get a magic morning pass!,1
25939,"This was the 1st time we took our children to Disneyland. They loved it. Since we typically go to Disney World, it is fun to see what things are different. The biggest difference is the lay out since they don't have the same space as Florida, so trying to figure out what to do until our fast passes while waiting for Splash Mountain since it is a long walk to other attractions.",1
25930,"Yes the crowds can be horrendous, but what a magic place this is. Rides are great and yes the lines can be a put off, but at certain times we waited less than 10 minutes to get on rides such as Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean. Oh and if you are hungry try one of the Smoked Turkey legs, they are a great meal.",1
25924,"Great visit to Disneyland and Calif Adventure. Surprisingly, not overly crowded on Labor Day weekend, especially Friday.",1
25925,It was a great experience. My kids enjoyed every part of it. The staff there were all friendly. We had a fast pass so that made the lines almost dissapear.,1
25926,"Loved it for the 3rd time in 6 years! This place instantly brings a smile to my children, my wife and myself. I love the music, atmosphere and just about every aspect of the park. The food and drink prices are outrageouse, but if you don't like it bring your own water and leave to eat your meals.",1
25927,"We are annual pass holders and we absolutely love Disneyland & California Adv....but I do not know what the problem was on Labor Day (yesterday) ...because rides kept getting shutting down. We had some friends, that we had met up with there and most of the rides they had went on kept breaking down. We were a little more lucky, but in the end we went to get in a line and they told us the ride was temporarily down for 10 15 mins. too! I am sure these things happen every once in a while because look at the amount of attractions they are operating at these parks, and of course safety is of the up most importance. So, even though we can get frustrated, they are trying to do what is best for the consumers safety, that is a good thing!! We just felt bad for our friends because it may of been their last chance to go before their passes ran out and I am sure that is not the way a family would like to spend their day. On another positive note, the parks were very good at giving them additional fast passes to use to compensate them! So that was another good thing!So, my advice is, we know Disneyland IS THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH, but just try to go there with an open mind that these things can happen. You may not always get to do what you hope to do, but there are always plenty of other fun things to do & keep you busy. It is all in our attitudes, right? : )A list of some of the rides that had broken down (that we were aware of) of course there were some others that were closed for the changing of seasons : )Note: some of these were back up & running later and weren't closed down the entire day!* Space Mountain* Splash Mountain* Scream'in Over California* Pinocchio's Daring Adventure* Pirates of the Caribbean So overall for our family, we had a great day & love this establishment and will keep coming back!!!!",1
25928,"Since I was 3 years old, that's how far back I can remember, I've loved this park.Through my life I've been in this park both as a guest, a Cast Member and more recently as an Annual Pass holder. All three pleasant and enjoyable in their own different ways.But as a pass holder, it's more magical than anything else. All Disney Parks are.So far I've been to 3 Disney Resorts. My favorite resort being the Tokyo Disney Resort, my favorite park is Epcot, but, my favorite park with the most history is Disneyland. If you've never taken an official tour at Disneyland, let me recommend you take the  A Walk in Walt's Footsteps  tour. It'll give you a great insight into what took for Walt and his brother Roy, to make Disneyland what it is today. From the planing to the implementation, all the way to Walt's Apartment.Disneyland truly is a family park, meaning that there is something for everyone here. From children's attractions in Fantasyland, to high paced space travel in Tomorrowland. They even have a place for those of you who are technology buffs. It's called Innoventions in Tomorrowland. Lots of fun gadgets in there that you can actually try out.The Blue Ribbon Bakery is one of my favorite places to get coffee and a sugar cookie at the start of my day in the park. It's just a tradition that I keep up through the years. I have to admit that I don't watch the parades anyone. I lost interest in them after the 50th Anniversary one went away. But I do love the fireworks and recommend anyone to stick around for them, specially during the holidays.Disneyland might not be big, but you'll be doing a lot of walking, so take good walking shoes with you. Even in summer, it can get chilli at night,so take something to cover up with, specially if you'll be watching Fantasmic, which, by the way, no one should miss that.So take some time off. Enjoy the Southern California sun in the Happiest Place on Earth.You'll make memories that will last you a lifetime.",1
25929,"We really enjoyed the park. We were there early in the morning took a break around 3, went to back to the hotel so the kids could play in the pool then headed back after 6 for evening fun. Bring a pair of comfortable shoes, lots of walking.",1
25931,"What can I say about Disney. Always love visiting even during summer when it can be very busy. New Star Tours was great, Dole Whip float was very yummy. Cant wait for my next visit!!!!",1
25938,"I'm not a huge lover of theme parks, but my husband planned a trip to the US for our family and of course, you can't not go to Disneyland. So with my kids being super excited and me being slightly apprehensive, and my husband just going along with anything, we arrived at Disneyland and now all I can say is WOW!! I honestly did not think I would enjoy it as much as I did. The rides were great for all ages, the shows including the fireworks and the parade were amazing! The food, whilst a bit pricey, but to be expected in theme parks, was great. As far as I am concerned here is nothing to complain about.The lines did occasionally get long, but given this mostly happened on rides with Fastpass, it was simple enough to get a time allocation for later and simply come back for little or no line up. We were constantly on the go.We purchased the City Pass, which gave us access for three days into Disneyland and Calafornia Adventure, and I think one of the best parts, is that you can get a pass out, to go back and forth between the two parks each day, as many times as you like each day. ",1
25932,"Disneyland doesn't fail to please, especially if you spend time before you go preplanning your day. One improvement Disney could make is to provide more shade in all queuing areas, especially out the front where people queue at the beginning of the day to wait to get in. Make sure you wear hats, sunscreen or even take an umbrella to protect you while you are in queues or waiting to see the parade. Take a bottle of water. You can refill it from the drinking fountains. I have been to Disneyworld Florida and Tokyo Disney and there is a consistent excellence in the appearance, service and quality of the Disney theme parks. This time round I used an online planning service called  Ridemax  to help me organise my day. For $15 it was worth it. It took the worry out of trying to figure out the best way to fit everything in. There is a  single rider  queuing option for some of the more popular rides at Disneyland. Definitely use this if you are by yourself, or if you don't really need to ride with your companions. You can all queue together, but ride separately. The single rider queue is often much faster than the  fast pass  queue. It is worth trying to get  fast passes  as often as possible, but don't be too concerned about getting to the ride inside the time window shown. I found that you could pretty much use the fast pass anytime after the start of the time period shown, even hours later.Plan to have your lunch (which you can bring with you) while you watch the  Billy Hill and the Hillbillies   show. There are tables, and the show is excellent.Get to disneyland at least half an hour before the opening time, so you don't waste time queuing at the beginning. Plan to stay until after the fireworks at night. The fireworks show is truly amazing and is best viewed from the main street area in front of the castle. It is worth saving a spot at least 30 or 45minutes before the fireworks so that you can get a good view. Maybe plan to eat some dinner there while you are waiting!It's nice to see that Disneyland is providing healthier food options these days, with trays of cut fruit and similar available in several areas.If you are pressed for time I would skip the  Innovations  attraction, the Captain Eo attraction (unless you are a huge Michael Jackson fan), the Tiki Room attraction and the train ride around the park's perimeter. They all take a fair bit of time, and there are much better attractions that are worth doing twice, like  Star Tours  (which as 2 variations).Disneyland needs at least 2 days to be enjoyed fully with all the attractions and shows. If you are going to Disneyland California adventure try to spend at least 2 days there, as well.",1
25933,"Disneyland is amazing. I had already seen the florida park and loved it, and was super excited for the original. its hot and crowded but everything is wroth the wait. Cars land get full quick i would suggest getting there as soon as it opens otherwise ytou will be waiting 3 hrsIf you have little girls or like me a little girl at heart. go to Ariels Grotto for lunch in california adventure park, you will probably get to met a few princess. Get an autograph book to for them to sign.Amazing for big kids and small ones. The fireworks and world of colour is awsome, you can get pririty seeting for world of colour , if you cant get that tha i would suggest positioning yourself right out the front of the Ariel ride, you will notice on the concreate little holes where they put up the rope, sit there about 2hrs before hand.",1
25934,"loved the park and the fact that you pay one price and that allows you to do everything in the park.  what I didn't like is the lineups in and out of the park, security check points, way over done.",1
25935,"As above. That is all you need to know really. It is an excellent park. Disneyland Tokyo is the last on my list now, having been to Euro Disney and Disney World several times.I have grown perhaps cynical of the phrase  customer service  over the years, but Disney again show what it truely is. Myself and the wife have been to Disney several times over the years, but this was our first time as a married couple (indeed it was our honeymoon). On discovering we were on honeymoon, we were both given wonderful  just married  badges (for free I might add), and this led to a superb (if not perhaps at times surreal) day of folks (staff and visitors) congratulating us. Made for a wonderful day. Thank you all.",1
25936,The best part of disneyland is everything. If I could I would go there always. I love everything about this place it just gives me so much happiness when I get to go there and i'm 24 yrs old. It's never too old to go to disneyland. Disneyland has given me so much beautiful memories with my family and friends. It's the best place in the whole wide world!!!,1
25937,"Disneyland   was there 25 years ago and back with my daughter this time around. Still awesome   staff serving you with food, giftshops or on rides or just generally on there way from A to B around the park were very very friendly and happy. It was an absolute joy to re visit.",1
25959,"CA Disney is different from FL if you have been to both, but it was exactly what we expected from a Disney park and we thoroughly enjoyed it",1
25960,"Our group are no strangers to Disneyland. We go once or twice a year and have been going forever. This trip had exhausting heat, high humidity and a tremor. And nice short lines, too.  The only thing I can recommend is to try to stay in the shade as much as you can. The sun will take everything out of you fast. Seek shade, stay hydrated, get on the rides as often and fast as you can. When there is an earthquake, Disneylnad automatically closes all rides. There is no announcment made in the park about this. You are walking around to your next ride, it;s closed. So is the one after that. By the third one, you know something is wrong. The employees are willing to explain the situaion. Once the rides are safety inspected, they are reopened. I can see the need. I just have to say, that was a first for me at Disneyland.  Eat before you think you have to, the crowds are smaller and you will feel much better. We noticed our favorite restaurant (Hungry Bear) had changed its french fries to sweet potato fries. That either works for you or it doesn't. We left quickly to another eatery.  It will be better in December when we go back. We won't be spending all our money on drinks. Also  try not to look lost or confused in the park. Twice I was approached by Disney employees asking if I needed help. I was waiting to meet other people in my party who were on rides I had opted out on. I felt kind of stupid, but I know they are just doing their job.",1
25962,"Loved the new expanded California Adventure Park. So much more to see and do. Carsland was very interesting so many things to see and do in this new land.Went to Mad T Party at night in California Adventure Park (Hollywood backlot) Dj and bank featuring Alice was a blast love dancing, dancing, Dancing!",1
25992,Carsland Rocked! The park is always clean and places Six Flag theme parks in the dust! We will continue coming for the years to come!,1
25984,My wife and I enjoyed our trip to Disneyland (together we have been to WDW & Epcot Center in FL). We went on a Sunday and lines were very short all day (5 10 minute wait times) and we actually didn't need to use the fastpass system. A great combination of classic rides and some that have been updated (Star Tours). We really enjoyed (and would strongly recommend) the fish tacos at the Mexican restaurant in Frontierland for lunch at about $11 per plate. Parking could be a bit clearer on Google Maps.,1
25985,"Being a big Disneyworld fan, I had low expectations of Disneyland but was very pleasantly surprised. It was just as charming and while it must be smaller, it felt just as modern and updated as its Florida cousin. Food was mediocre but not outrageously priced. We went the day the majority of children in CA went back to school and we were told the crowds were smaller that day. Employees were very accommodating and were able to convert days off of our lifetime tickets from Disneyworld into single day park hopper Disneyland tickets with cheerful no hassle help. Some rides seemed better at Disneyland, like Pirates of the Caribbean and the Teacup ride and all of storybook land but others like the Haunted Mansion was not as elaborate or as fun. The night we were there, the park was open til midnight and we were able to get tons of rides in between 9 and midnight. The Cinderella castle is so small compared to Disneyworld but the whole place is just as magical. ",1
25986,"Travelled with my 76 year old father, 13 year old daughter, 9 year old son and 5 year old autistic son.  Had a blast; the workers were extremely nice and helpful.",1
25987,"Disneyland gets better every time I visit   and I have been 9 times since 1970. There is something for everyone from toddlers to seniors. The place is sparkling clean and FUN! The new CARS race track is fun..... just get there at 8am and get a fast pass, because they go FAST! The Disney World of Color water show was AMAZING, just don't be in the front few rows or you will get completely drenched (not the  light mist  they promised.. haha). Star Tours has been updated and is as fun as ever.",1
25989,"I traveled with my 8 year old son and had a wonderful time.  We spent 2 days between Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure.  Haven't been there for years, but glad to see Disneyland still has that magical atmosphere.",1
25991,"Had a great time!! Celebrated my in laws 45 wedding anniversary at Disneyland. Food was kind of expensive, but with the fastpass system we did not have to wait long!",1
25993,"It's the king of all attraction parks, perfect and timeless. If you have little girls, don't miss out on the Bibidi babidi boo Boutique, where they turn your little ones into princesses complete with hairdoo, makeup and nail polish (I think little boys are made up to be knights, not sure). Call in advance and book early in the day. Fantastic! Also remember to learn about the fast pass system and how to use it in advance, it is FREE and will maximize your experience. ",1
25982,"Had a great Disneyland Getaway from 8 22 12 thru 8 24 12 to celebrate the August birthdays of my nephews (ages 2, 5, & 8). While Cars Land was still quite crowded, Disneyland Park was surprisingly not crowded. Some members of my family were able to take advantage of early entry to get on the new rides at Cars Land and all raved about Radiator Springs. We also tried the Character Breakfast at Plaza Inn to celebrate the toddler's birthdays and it was a highlight of the trip. Can't wait to go back next month!",1
25994,"Parade and fireworks are excellent, took my girls for a makeover at the Bibbidi Bobbidi boutique which they loved although was $$$$'s!",1
25995,Our kids are 6 and 8 years old. Just to see them have fun in the park was the best experience. Food was not good. Ashame that Disneyland does'nt do a better variety of food.,1
25997,"Being a CA native, I was so excited to finally take the kids to see Mickey. Fast Passes are the way to go. Get a fast pass, go to another ride, go back to the fast pass ride. It was so easy. The only thing that i didnt like was the fact that we sat and waited for the fireworks show and were told 25 min before they started that we had to stand and make room for those who didn't. but other than that, we had a great time!",1
25998,"Got go again after 15 years since my kids were young. Best trick is to get those Fast Passes so you can come back to the line and NOT bother waiting. They have improved some old rides like the Pirates of the Caribbean, and why not? Hydrate lots and be prepared for lineups for rides, shows, fireworks, food and restrooms.",1
25999,"Good time of the year to visit, cooler and less crowded. There were a few rides down for maintainance but it was still fun.",1
26000,"like the american atmosphere, easygoing, food, the peacefull evening. too many people during the day",1
25983,"We made a return trip to Disneyland during the third week of August with a family group that included a 3 month old, and we had a great time. Disneyland is every bit as clean and well managed as always, and the rides every bit as fun. We had hesitated about going in August because we expected long lines, but we were pleasantly surprised, never having to wait more than 20 minutes. Even the rides that are still more than 20 years old still look new; the only thing that seemed dated was the Michael Jackson  Captain EO  movie, which doesn't feature the laser show and other effects of the original presentation. The Disney crew was friendly and visitors were on their best behavior as well, so Disneyland lived up to its billing as a happy place. As others have written, food is pricey (it's hard to get a lunch with drink for under $13), but for those with that concern there are some inexpensive restaurants within easy walking distance.",1
25981,We had a wonderful time visiting Disneyland last week for a few days.  The crowds were manageable for the summer and our entire family had a wonderful time.  We have so many great memories and I'm glad we decided to go!,1
25963,Went to both parks in one day   don`t recomend. Try to spend a whole day in each one. At Disney Downtown you will find good places to eat and drink.,1
25971,"It's hard to find something original to say about such a classic park, but nowhere else has the Matterhorn Bobsleds, and the exterior of It's a Small World is impressive! We enjoyed the submarine ride (based around Finding Nemo) too and love the Indiana Jones ride   very clever!",1
25964,"For a day, we were kids again. I love Disney World in Florida, and Disneyland was just as fun and magical! We only had one day to visit Disneyland and California Adventure. It can be done, but you will miss some rides. We did it without kids, from park open to close, and went on a Tuesday after school started (although August is still a busy time no matter what). We also did not have any sit down meals   we just picked up some quick bites and snacks throughout the park as we went. But, to be honest, the lines were nothing compared to Disney World and really not that long compared to Cars Land in California Adventure. I think the longest line we waited on was Space Mountain (which was better than the one in Disney World!) and that was maybe 40 minutes. The Indiana Jones line is always long, so I would recommend getting a Fast Pass there. If you have kids with you and want to take a more leisurely time, I would recommend a full day in each park.",1
25965,"Excellent, Excellent.......It is the best place in the world.  I love it each time I go.  I become a kid when I go thru the doors and anything goes.",1
25966,"Name the superlative that makes you happy and don't sneeze on the pixie dust; you're in for world of whirl! No, you are not too old or too jaded to ride  It's a Small World  especially if you remember it from 1964 in NY Tinkerbell loves you! Enjoy! ",1
25967,Disneyland was great although very busy with long witing times in the summer. It was also quite warm.,1
25969,"The crouds were smaller early in day. End of Augest has many getting ready for school and time of spent vacations. Staff was helpful.and lines were reasonable. At night locals flood in but night attractions worth staying at park. Food selection limited,as are restrooms so be prepared. ",1
25970,I love everything about Disneyland! My kids are 4 now & we have been going since they were 1 1 2 & they love it. They are now tall enough to go on all the rides & know where everything is. The only thing that was a bummer is my video camera was stolen(by the Cars ride in CA Adventure). Keep your stuff close unfortuately not everyone is there to have a good time.,1
25972,This park never ceases to disappoint. The rides are fun. The park is always clean. You feel safe if your party splits to ride different rides. The price of food is high. Disneyland does allow you to bring your own food in. I bring my backpack filled with goodies. There are little shows and shops tucked in every corner. Disneyland is still a very magical place.,1
25980,"Plenty of fun. Total family entertainment. The rides keep you going. What else can you say, it's disneyland!",1
25973,"I Love Disneyland, the parade throughout main street is Awesome, the rides are fun and the characters are friendly and willing to smile for the camera even in the sweltering heat! Try to go near a special time of year ie: Halloween; Christmas etc as they decorate the park to match with the holiday theme and even have spectacular fireworks shows! I have and will continue to visit the park :)",1
25975,"Truly the happiest place on Earth. Make sure you go early on a weekday to avoid the long lines, and crowds. Start at one end and go on everything.",1
25976,"I've been going to Disneyland since it opened..... I haven't been back in at least 12 years, (have been to Disney World in the past 6 years) There have been so many changes. I loved that a lot had been updated. I suggest you get there when it opens, we got there about 9 and got on seveeral big rides as soon as we walked up. Buy noon the waits started and soon they were between 50 90 minute waits. I hate waiting more than about 20 minutes. We left and came back at 7, a big mistake, even longer rides. The fast track did help.",1
25977,"*** Disclaimer***  I have been to Walt Disney World (in Florida) many many times. I loved it so much, I actually worked there for a good amount of time. I might judge Disneyland a little harder because of this.I bought park hoppers. Park hoppers allow you to go to both parks in one day. $125 per adult. A one day ticket at around $89 will only allow you into only ONE park a day. Save your tickets because you use them to get fast passes. Send the fastest family member with all of your tickets to get fastpasses. They have machines infront of the select rides who offer the pass.  I was excited to go to Disneyland because Disney is what I do and love. Additionally, I have never been to Disneyland. They had easy parking and an efficient tram system to get you to the parks, which were located very near to each other. We went to California Adventures first. I suggest going to Magic Kingdom first if you have never gone to Disney because it is great to walk in and see Sleepy Beauty's castle.  Cali Adventures  We went to Car's Land first, but that is where EVERYONE was around 12. Go to Cars Land at night during World of Color (which you have to get fast passes for near Grizzly Canyon) because it will be less crowded. Go there first to get fast passes as well because they will be sold out around 10 am. On MIckey's Ferris Wheel  DO NOT get the swinging seats if you get sea sick  there is a seperate line to get in for that. I went to 6 different shops to get a 1st visit badge, and no one had one. That is understandable, but no one went above and beyond to help us find any. We eventually got one back at the front at guest services. People were friendly, but not like they are at Disney World. They seemed to be more bored  less inventive (is this because I worked at Disney World ? ). I saw cast members leaning and chatting with eachother. We then went to magic Kingdom. Get there before Wishes start, so you can get a picture with you and the castle in the light. Go do Fantasyland first for rides because some rides close down after during Wishes. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride is a personal favorite ( it is no longer at Disney World, so it was great to ride it here). The popcorn girl in Magic Kingdom was very kind, so I went to Guest Services, like I know to do, and comment on her kindness. The guest service gentlemen didn't seem to care at all with what I was doing. He was HESITANT to even fill it out. I was confused on why he didn't start writing right away. He then just quickly jotted down my comment. There was NOBODY in line, so I don't understand why he wasn't more excited for his other cast member that she is receiving good recognition Haunted Mansion is MY favorite ride of all time. Go here if you are hot, but it might be scary for little ones. Fastpasses Get them first for Indiana Jones, Car's Land the racing cars, Soaring, and your favorite Fantasyland rides (they are popular because those are great for all kids adults). The Aladdin show at Cali Adventures is a must see. Go there during the hottest parts of the day.  Ask for first visit buttons or any button that might pertain to you like, Just Married etc.It was hard to see everything in a day, so pick your must sees and do those first. There are not a lot of quick service dining located inside the actual restaurants, so go eat around 2 3pm to easily get tables in the shade. Look out for Hidden Mickeys as well. They sell books on these.Disneyland is a must see for everybody at least once. The more you are open to fun and magic, you will have an outstanding time. If you have a not so great time, don't give up. Go again. I know that the Disney way is to make sure all guests are happy. Even though Disneyland's outstanding guest service wasn't the best for me, it is still better than other parks. I also gave a 4 5 because hardly anyone recognized my button. Even though I am 24, they should still give me some acknowledgement. Again:Why you should choose Disney parks?  Fast Passes are free, SAFE, Clean, magical, family oriented, theming, and a lot to do.Thank YouPS: Unlike Universal, you carry your bags onto the rides. There aren't lockers for everyride to store your items. I like Disney's way better than Universal's.",1
25978,"This is my most favourite place on earth. Clean, fun, happy, lots of variety of food, shopping, rides. This is just heaven on earth. Had not been here in about 20 years and when I went back it was even better. It just gets better with age!",1
25979,"We Likes EVERYTHING! Disneyland was PERFECTLY FUN AND VERY EXCITING. Each year we try to go to Orange County and Visit Disneyland, the Beach, and one more park, either an L.A. or an Orange County Park. If you FLY, and take the Shuttle hotel bus to your hotel, there are MANY shuttles leaving for ANY PLACE in Orange County, as well and ALL of So. Cal. These shuttles leave for Disneyland wvery 20 minutes, and to the airport every hour!!! Then when you want to go to the beach or Knott's, or Los Angeles (Universal Studios0 The Bus coes from the Hotel and Takes you where you neen to go too! This is the life! Vacations WORRY and STRESS F R E E ! Enjoy Everyone you Desearve it!",1
25764,Disneyland changes a little from time to time but the way they do things never does. It is always fun for all ages and the parade which is at night is fantastic just try to position yourself near the exit so you dont struggle to get out. The food is expensive for what it is but you expect that. Some of the food serving staff could be a little but happier as well but otherwise nothing lets them down. A great experience time after time!,1
25763,"We have been to Disneyland a few times and each time it has been a fantastic experience. The updated Star Tours ride is brilliant with a number of different story lines so each time you ride, you could get a different experience. The Halloween parade and party was brilliant. The park has rides   activities for all ages. Our kids are 9 and 10 loved all the rides from the classic Autopia, space mountain, Nemo, Pirates of the Carribean to the Wild West train. The staff are very friendly and the park is extremely clean",1
25762,"We enjoyed our day here at DL and thought that it has improved since our last visit in 09. We did all the rides not long wait times either as we went in SEptember! We went back to hotel in the late afternoon then came back to watch the fireworks and fantasmic shows where the crowds increased. Staff are great, food is what you expect for theme parks, everyone must go!",1
25518,"Loved all the old favourites, but they really need to add something new.  Lineups for the food service were terrible, and nowhere to sit to eat it.",1
25540,Love going to Mickeys Halloween Treat and the new California Adventure   All the great decorations and the fun Halloween decorations on Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain,1
25541,"we like the fun, the games, the characters.  we donot like the food so much.  we like the parking area and the transport bus, and the organization of the staff",1
25542,"Loved it here. Was alot of fun, the rides were a bit tamer than California Adventure Park. Would definately come back, especially with kids. Kids would love it here! The staff were friendly, we felt very safe on the rides! We spent one a a half days here which was enough to cover all of the rides! Great day!",1
25543,"The best way to experience Disneyland is to buy passes so that you can go for a few hours (during the week is much less crowded of course) and leave when you get tired. Or, our option B is to go for a while and when it get's too crowded or hot, go to downtown Disney and grab some lunch or see a film. In fact, one of my favorite movie experiences is to grab some warm beniets from Brennan's (for the best movie treats on the plane bar nonet!!) and enjoy a couple of hours away from the sometimes maddening, although mostly happily docile, crowds. ",1
25544,We are in the older age group but there is so much for anyone of any age to see and do. The park is kept in immaculate condition from the state of the rides to the cleanliness of the walkways and shops. Definitely a place to put on your bucket list!!!,1
25546,Wow what a great place for people of all ages!!!!  I personally think it is wasted on childres lol.  The detail just blew me away.  The place is spotless and so well maintained!!!!  Nothing is out of place!,1
25547,"What a blast   definitely the best way to do Disneyland.  Costumes, candy, no lines   7 of us celebrating my birthday had a great time and already planning next year!",1
25548,I preferred Disneyland to Disney World.  Just thought Disneyland was he perfect size and found the staff their more cordial and friendly.  Can't wait to go back,1
25549,"What can I say about Disneyland that you don't already know. This park is pure magic for the kids and fun for the adults. Fast Pass makes waiting for rides much easier. We were able to get a fast pass for Splash Mountain, go for lunch, and then get through the ride 15 minutes after we finished eating. Disney know how to do this right.",1
25550,"I have not been to Disneyland in 15 years, so we were excited to take our 3 kids to Disneyland for the first time. We were told October was a great time to go to avoid crowds, but that was not accurate for us. It was extremely crowded. We did love seeing Disneyland decorated for Halloween, but due to the crowds, I would never go back in October again. I did not like how they changed Space Mountain for Halloween. We were also disappointed that Indiana Jones was closed, but I realize they have to close rides for maintenance, it's just disappointing. Absolutely loved Cars Land! There is still a lot of Disney Magic in Disnleyland, but I have to say overall we enjoyed California Adventures better. We also went to Mickey's Halloween party, but I would never do that again. First of all, way overpriced. It was sold out so it was extremely crowded. There's long lines for the trick or treating. Extremely long lines if you want your picture taken with characters. The only upside is most people were not on the rides, so it was short lines for most rides. We still love Disneyland and will definitely be back, just not in October. If it's really important for you to see Disneyland during Halloween, just be prepared for the crowds!",1
25552,"i am a local, i grew up in orange county but due to the rising cost of admission, i had not been to disneyland in about 5 years and the magic of visiting is still there. A downside is the cost of admission, and of course the crowds so for the main rides, get a fastpass rather than spend an hour or two in line. the food there was still great, and it was a bit more upscale than i remember and with more flavor.",1
25553,Great as always  Loved updated Star Tours   absolutely brilliant  Went to Mickeys Halloween Party which was great,1
25554,"I enjoyed the rides and the concepts at Disneyland better. Where there was a Mickey and Minnie house in Disneyworld (now removed), Disneyland has an entire town with homes for Donald, Goofy, Mickey, Minnie, Chip and Dale, a city hall, fire hall, gag hall... and the list goes on.And about 2 times the number of rides over Magic Kingdom. You may have to go to Hollywood studios, Magic Kingdom and Epcot to see the same rides that are all together at Disneyland (and California Adventures which is across the street in Anaheim).",1
25555,Cars Land!.. A must do!!.. this is an awesome ride.  Worth the wait.  Loved the ride. Eventhought the wait was long but I would definetly do it again!.. all the rides in cars land are great for the kids and adults.,1
25556,"as a walt disney world fan, i still cant get use to the itty bitty castle, but all of the favorites are here with less walking",1
25539,"We went on a bus trip from our hotel which was the best thing we did.We expected it to be crowded,but were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't.Of course the gift shops were over priced.we found the a nice little restaurant and was served by a really lovely girl and food was great.The rides were really tame.The highlight of our whole day was the parade,and then the fire works.You can actually see the whole park in 1 day if you are organized,we were ready to leave but waited for the fireworks,have seen better though at my local park so if your tired skip this but not the parade,line up early,use this time to grab a drink.",1
25537,We enjoyed Disneyland but it doesn't even compare to Disney World.  It can easily be done in 2 3 days.  Nice for younger toddler age kids.  We liked that we  could walk to the hotels from the parks.,1
25536,"Everytime I go to Disneyland, I am impressed with how well things run. It is always clean, the staff is friendly, and they continuously work on improving their rides. We are members at Club 33 which is an oasis in the midst of all the chaos. The only negative is that the prices keep skyrocketing!",1
25527,"Areil's Grotto.  Get your daughter dressed up the a princess, shell out the bucks for a GREAT luncheon and watch the excitment unfold!  Absolutley PRICELESS!!!",1
25520,"This really is a happy place, allow plenty of time though as lines can be long on the popular rides.  Get a photo pass they are great value.",1
25521,Everything you would expect a Disney attraction to be. We prefer Disney World but mostly because it is larger and the crowds spread out more,1
25523,We had the best time at Disneyland! And the most delicious food choices! Definetly a family atmosphere,1
25524,Perfect!! Wonderful time of year to visit!  Crowds were great.  Halloween at Disney is magical! Would absolutely recommend this trip for anyone who has children over 4!,1
25525,We came as the halloween decorations were put up.  It was very festive and fun.  I wish there was a fast pass for the Matterhorn.,1
25526,The park was not too crowded on this weekday 3 day visit. since it was during halloween the decorations were so fun with pumpkins all over the place! The haunted mansion was transformed into The Nightmare Before Christmas. Ride lines were not very long. It was fun. We are excited to bring our kids here...once we have kids.,1
25528,"Growing up in Southern California was a lot of fun. It was always a treat when the folks said let's go to Disneyland (Yeah!!!). Back in the 60's you'd buy a book of tickets and always were sad when the E Tickets were gone. Later in life my wife and I would get the Annual Pass so we could go when we wanted to and we did use them a lot. We used them to the point people working there recognized us. When people ask us what do we like better, Disneyland or Disneyworld? We would alway reply, One is not better than the other just different yet exciting. If you go to Southern California, make it to Disneyland you will not be disappointed one bit.",1
25535,"I was really not looking forward to this trip. The small size caused some concern.If you are a Disney person or really enjoy the history of Walt Disney it is really an amazing experience. This is the park Walt did see, grow and experience.We were impressed by food choices and not the bad wedding food WDW has been shoveling out for years. Cast members still have some magic spirit.It is small and easy to miss all the  hidden  gems. Some helpful hints, strollers must be closed on the monorail and train. The monorail is not an attraction like WDW 3 4 minutes one way.",1
25529,Took advantage of the Haunted Tour...three hours of amusing tour guide interactions and front of the line privelages to five of the two parks' most popular rides!,1
25530,Always love the Disney experience but it is getting very expensive. The food is overpriced and not that good. Disney has a long way to go in that area. We walked out of the park and ate off property. Even Downtown Disney is overpriced and not that good.....30 dollars for a terrible pizza that was not enough for 4.,1
25531,We have been season passholders for years and have brought family memebers and friends. We have brought people ranging from newborn all the way to 89 years old and we always have a fabulous time! Disney really knows how to treat their guests and make them feel special!,1
25532,"We had an awesome time at the park. Wish they had more water features because it was super hot, but we had a good time anyway!",1
25533,"Seriously? What's not to like? I'm 50 years old and have been going to Disneyland since I was a child. I and my wife are annual passholders and visit as often as we have the opportunity. We recently had the privilege of sharing our grandson's first visit and while he's too young to be able to remember it, it was a joy to see the expressions on his face when he would see the characters and hear the music he's heard and seen on TV. People say it's expensive and it probably is, but there is no vacation spot on the planet where you can find literally everything you want to do for all ages in one clean convenient location. It truly is the happiest place on earth!",1
25534,"Had a nice time. Loved the new Cars ride, a must do. Much smaller than Disney World but also much less intimidating. Can stay off property and still be very close walking distance to Park.",1
25557,"You need as least 3  4 days to experience everyting in both parks. We had 3 full days from morning to closing and still missed a few things. You need to use your fast pass regularly to save time and as Cars Land is new it is really busy. Make sure you line up for a fastpass for the Cars Racing Ride first up as this ride is the busiest and fast passes will sell out by early afternoon. We found the food at the park reasonably priced and bought lunch or dinner there, rather than wasing time to leave and come back. Make sure you see all of the night shows   Fireworks, World of Color and Mickey Mouse vs The Evil Queen. They are spectacular and I think the best attractions at both the parks. You can get a fastpass for the World of Color which will ensure you get a good viewing spot. Otherwise people start waiting in good viewing spots a 2 hrs prior. ",1
25558,"I visited disneyland on my own and still had the amazing experience i thought i would.Originally i wasn't going to go on my own but had some convincing from friends that had visited before and they weren't wrong.I travelled to disney via public transport from hollywood which is a cheap but loonng options (2 1 2 hrs) because there was lack of one way trips to get there for open   close. I arrived at 8am and left at 12:30am long day but well worth it, i reccomend staying the whole day. Some tips for you to have the most enjoyable experience:  arrive early and then you can stay till late (try to as disneyland changes at night)  plan, plan, plan! i had a plan before i even visited which helped massively, even then sat down and got my bearings of the park  be nice to the staff and they will help you out with advice etc.  for fantasmic show and fireworks get early to the river of dreams (1hr 1.1 2hr) and just stay in your place for the fireworks (in front of the castle is busy and theres not much reason to move)The above got me through one of the memorable days of my life, the shows fantasmic and the fireworks are of the quality you expect for disney and AMAZING. I had a spot on the river of dreams and made friends with a family who accomodated me since i was on my own.If i was to come again to see califorina adventure id stay closer as 5am   3am is kinda crazy lolSad to leave but happy to leave with memories forever",1
25559,"This park, although it's much smaller than it's follow up park in central Florida, is special because, it encompasses Walt Disney's personal dreams, ideas, and was the start of what was to turn out to be the  1 Tourist Destination for children and their parents in the world. The versions of the ride attractions are slightly different from Disney Park to Disney Park, so this one has its own unique charm, as well as a ride or two that the other parks didn't get, like The Matterhorn, one of my personal favorites.",1
25587,"Capture the original magic. The magic is better on less crowded days, so do your research to help avoid crowds so large that they close the park and you can't even walk at a stead pace. It took a few visits to really navigate the park and find all the little tricks to make my visits more effective and it still takes advance planning for multi day visits to coordinate the night time fireworks and shows. Don't just show up at Disneyland without some advance preparation. You'll be glad you did.",1
25581,What can be said about Disneyland that hasn't already been said! It is my favorite vacation destination! My family and I go at least twice and year and love each of our adventures there! I recommend you go to the park early and enjoy it before the crowds get too bad. Or if you have a choice go on a weekday during the off times because I don't think it's quite as fun when it is packed!,1
25582,Parade a little too long.Grandson had a great time. Bathrooms could use a little up grading. Food and drinks a little on the expensive side. But what are you going to do Walt.,1
25583,"Clean, Fun and a great way to spend the day. We loved the Halloween decorations and the Nightmare Before Christmas haunted house. The kids love all the rides. We were surprised at how many healthy food options there were. Food was great! What a great way to spend a day with the kids or a week. lol",1
25584,"Found that the food and essential fluids very very expensive in all the parks   Water was $3.65 US., and during a heat wave what we had brough in was hot by lunchtime... so expensive 3 days just for the basics. Also, so many pushchairs and babies, far too young to be at this tpe of place, esp. in the heat.",1
25585,"I went to the Disneyland because of my sister in law, who has never been to any of the Disney parks. It is Disneyland, so it is impossible to not to remember your childhood and become emotional. But it is a park for small kids, so don't expect any of thrilling rides. The Fantasmic show was amazing, this visit was worth because of it, otherwise I'd prefer going to Six Flags or other parks with more thrilling attractions. I also watched the fireworks, but after you watch Fantasmic it just becomes a regular attraction.",1
25586,"This revue is on distance and location of off site lots(toy story etc)I am a regular WDW visitor and now living in the Rocky Mountain Region go to Anahiem yearly to visit DLR.My problem occured on a trip with a 2 year old and still learning the street layout near park and resort property.When entering the resort area you are directed to parking by flashing signs and police cars blocking street lanes.this is very different from Disney World parking and roads.As I know a majority of guests are locals this may not be a concern at the Anahiem resort but for non locals it is a big deal as I will explain.Now on 2 trips we ended up in off site lots,not knowing that main lot(Mickey and friends was not full)For anyone not familiar with the area go to main multi level parking lot if open.Homeless people in a dark sidewalk where behind shrubs and a hit and run on another trip across the street.My main criticism is why is the signage so limited in the area?also outside property sidewalks are clean and well done but again if Guests are possibly walking to lots as in my case,where are directions to the parking areas?After a long day in the parks i dont need to get lost just outside gates when trying to find my car!Prices are the same at Fl.and Cal.resorts so to expect different standards for safety or convienance makes no sense to me!This is dirrected to Disney propery staff and would like an explanation of this as I spend Thousands on My trips and I find this unexeptable for anyone visiting a family friendly resort.I know about buses but with a stroller and myself a long distance walker I prefer often to walk to my car now with a child.Please change Your directions and signs to lots and enterences,lighting and cast members at frindges of property would help also!A lot attendent at cast parking had no idea you had off site parking lots and told me speeding cars entering Your parking lot would hit me if I did not move fast.Again being a regular visitor and traveled to Hong kong Disneyland I know the Disney standards are high,but the Anahiem Resort needs help with these problems.Riot police and murders outside the gates and not inviting for out of state fans.Make the streets more friendly and inviting,from getting off the hywy a new tourist should feel safe and assured of a great experience is in store for them!Your Park built that city and should show it everywhere a guest is locally to it.",1
25588,"We visit for Halloween, its a blast, we can all dress up as a family and tric or treat for candy, do the rides and never worry about traffic, cars or the odd questionable candy. The candy is safe and they do hand out healthy choices.",1
25579,"Sheesh, how do you review the Happiest Place on Earth? We just came back from a Mickey's Trick or Treat party and had a blast. It was fun seeing so many people visiting the park in costume. Just about all the rides were up and running and one of the few that I can remember that was closed was It's a Small World getting the Christmas overlay I was told. The Pirates Ride and Haunted Mansion are a couple of our favorites and never seem to get old. One of the few negatives I will give is the new Matterhorn bobsled cars are a step backwards. The line was very very short and I wanted to ride the Matterhorn again and try out the new cars. What a disappointment, I felt like my knees were up around my ears, it jostled me back and forth so bad that I went most the ride hanging onto the bar in front of me to help me lean forward away from the seat. It was bad enough that I did not ride it again and may not in the future. But other than that the park is alot of fun. The cast members (CM) are so friendly and we love to visit and chat and we had a great time dancing at Pirate Palooza. The CM that was playing Chip at the Pirates Palooza was being so awesome with the youngsters, while Pluto, Goofy and Donald were going all out dancing around Chip was holding hands with numerous youngsters and slow dancing with them and talk about super smiles from those kids. 5 stars for Chip!",1
25589,"We spent 3 days in Disneyland and California Adventure in October. Disneyland is always fun but there seemed to be alot more people than I remember...it felt like Christmas Day in Magic Kingdom Florida. My favourite ride is Space Mountain but I enjoyed all the other rides too. Star Wars Tours has been updated and is very fun, as is Pirates of the Caribbean and Splash Mountain. The Haunted Mansion was decorated for Halloween and very enjoyable. Thunder Mountain is always good and Toon Town brings out the kid in everyone. I went on Peter Pan for the first time and was surprised how cute it was...Disney at its best. At the Winnie the Pooh store by Splash Mountain we purchased some caramel chocolate apples  Hunny Apples ...absolutely delicious. It was the only store on Disney property that sold that particular apple treat. Brought one home with me..yummm. We had alot of fun all 3 days and enjoyed the fireworks and Fantasmic once again. I LOVE the Disney parks in Florida but it was a nice change to go to Disneyland California. Although it was crowded, we managed to have a good time as always. I will always recommend Disney for everyone.",1
25590,I was just a kid the first time I came to a Disneyland with my Mom & Dad. Now I come to Disneylad with my kids and grandkids. I have no idea how many times I have been to Disneyland with family over the years I just know that we all aIways have FUN!,1
25592,"Disneyland is truly the Happiest place on earth! This was our second visit in the last few years; we couldn't wait to come back after an amazing time in December 2010. The park is decorated in Halloween decor. My highlights: Space Mtn Ghost Rider, Coffee with free refills all day at the shop on Main Street, Pumpkin Beignets at the Mint Julip Bar (they weren't advertised and are so delicious!), Disney Villians tent (Cruella Deville was hilarious and super interactive), and other characters I didn't see last time, like Jack Skellington with Sally. Oh, and soo funny, the Haunted Mansion added a freshly dug grave site (meaning it is empty!) for Sparky from Frankenweenie!Husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn & Suites. It is an awesome location, but we won't stay there again. We are comfortable in HIExpress level hotels, but this one is extremely worn down and I just felt uncomfortable with the cleanliness I think was lacking. It is really close and short walk to the main gates. We used three day park hoppers and were there from open to close each day. A note on CA Adventure   you do not have to rush for World of Color tickets anymore, but go directly to the Carsland Racer line for fast pass. Go right away!!!!The parks were super busy. We tried to be careful about our dates but unfortunately landed on Utah week. There were many many many strollers and loong lines. We never got on some of our favorites as the lines were so long. It's ok though, but make sure you look at blogs when planning if you can help it. Expect it to be crowded and take advantage of the shows and shops while the lines are long. I am so appreciative to Disney employees for keeping the magic alive.",1
25593,"I have been going to Disneyland the last week of September for many years, and it just gets better every year, especially the Halloween theming. Haunted Mansion Holiday and Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy are great, and I dare say more enjoyable than their non holiday counterparts. We try to do something new each year, the Happiest Haunts tour last time, and this time we spent more time exploring the area around the Big Thunder Ranch. There are animals for the children to interact with, but the neatest find was the barn filled with scarecrow pumpkins. We had the whole place to ourselves to pose and take pictures and then suddenly Woody appeared from nowhere. It was a nice memory of the time when character sightings were alway spontaneous instead of the scheduled line em up meet and greets. The character interaction is so much better when there is no pre formed line. Just around the corner there is a stage with holiday performers and a wonderful display of intricate pumpkin carvings outside the villians tent. Fantasyland is a joy as always since it still has the traditional dark rides that are going extinct in Florida. I did find the Matterhorn to be very painful this time around and could only sit through it once and then I was bruised and sore the rest of the trip. They need to swap out those cars for some with more padding or that can ride the rails more smoothly. Be sure to check the Disney website for Ride Refurbishments so you can plan accordingly if a ride is going to close during your stay. Also, any food location that serves fountain drinks has cups of water you can request free of charge (same size cup as a regular soda). Also, the Denny's across the street (by the non Disney hotels) sells the regular size Dasani water bottles for 99 cents if you want a bottle to carry around with you.",1
25594,We are annual pass holders and love everything Disney. We visit many times a year. Radiator Springs Racers were great this time!,1
25596,The musical parade was a hit with my kids. If you love Disneyland you will absolutely love it in October during Halloween.,1
25580,What's not to like about Disneyland. You either love it or your don't.  I recommend a three day pass so you can park hop and not be rushed.,1
25578,"Me and my fianc   visited Anaheim in April last year (I know, a bit late on the review!!) in a bid to fulfill one of my childhood dreams... Go to Disneyland! It did not disappoint! Everything just felt so magical and kiddie like! Only one downside: humongous crowds and long lines... I can't recommend the Fast Pass enough... But what else do you expect for one of the worlds best known attractions? Loved all the Disney themed foods, how everything was so articulately decorated and themed, how there's something different everyday... I want to come back, for both Halloween and Christmas just to see the decorations!! Great place, absolutely loved it, even for a 23 year old like me ;)",1
25560,"I used touringplans.com and got some tips for our week of travel of what days to go and what days to avoid. I was disappointed that there weren't more live shows like the Aladin show at DCA. Also, no Fantasmic or fireworks unless we were there on Friday or Saturday. There was a Halloween Party, but tickets were sold out by the time we decided to go and we couldn't nab any.",1
25567,"We have visited Disney Parks in Florida and Paris (our nearest) and we love Disneyland Ca. Many of the rides are longer and better than in France and we found some great food in the Park, albeit at Park prices but it was still good food. We had 6 days in the Happiest Place and thoroughly enjoyed it. We'll be back !",1
25561,I just love being here! This time we took A Walk in Walt's Footsteps Tour and it was AMAZING! We learned so much about the park that we didn't know already! We had a great time and really enjoyed Mickey's Halloween Party. We came home with so much candy!!!! We are now season pass holders! We can't get enough!,1
25562,"We are annual passholders for Disneyland and we live in Newport, OR. We are Disney nerds and love visiting the park whenever we get enough vacation days accrued. Disney is definitely a place were your can return to being a kid without being judged. The cast members are friendly, informative and genuine. Guest services are helpful and you never have to worry about them having an agenda. Disneyland is truly a magical place to visit with your family, just a date or going solo. We experienced Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party for the first time on October 23, 2012. We thought it was a little too crowded for the price we paid extra to experience it, but now we can say we experienced it just the same and we can mark it off the bucket list. If you plan to visit Disneyland do your research about the time of year your vacation is scheduled. Bring several pairs of comfortable shoes and socks, and bring a bag to carry stuff. Shop at the end of your visit, plan to stay at least 3 days if it's your first visit or you are traveling with little ones.",1
25563,"We loved being adults (late 20s) and being able to dress up and trick or treat. It is a blast of a party. The music, decorations and atmosphere is so much FUN. I highly recommend this party.",1
25564,My husband and I felt like little kids again at Disneyland. Its great fun and a must do when visiting LA.,1
25565,"Had a lot of fun here! Spent first day at Disneyland, second day at California Adventure, then back to Disneyland for the Mickey Halloween Party. The kids came back with LOADS of candy! Long line wait times, though and had trouble finding fast passes. We spent 3 days at Disneyland Resort in all, could have used maybe 1 extra day to see the shows and catch a couple of rides we missed. It was VERY busy and this was on October 18. Next time we will take the kids out of school and go during a less busy time.",1
25566,"I have been going to Disneyland in California since I was 2 (33 now). I still love it and cannot wait to take my own children someday. They may not have the most intense rides, like Six Flags, but the Disneyland Park is meant for families and the rides are meant for everyone, not just thrill seekers. There is a feeling about being in Disneyland. It is kind of like the feeling you get on Christmas morning: Pure happiness and joy. I love Disneyland and am always eager to go back. They keep everything so neat and clean and are always coming up with new and inventive ideas to keep their parks fresh and keep people coming back again and again.",1
25568,"Disneyland California is always a wonderful trip for the kids and even some of us who are still a kid at heart. We loved all of the rides and the adventures. We have lots of pictures to prove it. We liked using the FASTPASS. This helped us so much to get on the rides that had huge lines. Lots of different rides that appeal to all different age groups. The smallest grandchildren loved Disneyland's Toon Town the best, and the older ones still enjoyed playing around with them.",1
25577,"It is Disneyland, the happiest place on earth!  We missed Indiana Jones, but had a blast anyway! Also, be careful on the newly designe Matterhorn.....it is really jerky and hard.",1
25570,Disneyland NEVER fails to be the best part of our vacations! Has something for everyone! and no matter what people say about the cost it is so worth it!,1
25571,"My family and I had a great time. It truly is the happiest place on earth as cheesy as that sounds. Every staff right from characters, ride operators, vendors and cleaning staff are full of smiles, happy to answer questions etc. What an amazing experience. Food is expensive which is really the only downside we experienced, it can run you $40  just for simple hot dogs and pops but well worth it for the memories you'll make. I'd strongly recommend getting a magic morning pass (entry 1 horu early) and using it for some of those more popular rides; we used our to ride space mountain a couple of times back to back!",1
25572,"We went to Disneyland Park 10 12 10 13  and 10 15. We had a great time. The lines for everything were super long. Matterhorn was impossible even from the get. Never had an opportunity to ride even trying to get a fastpass was impossible. Pirates was even busy. 60 minutes. Some greats. Dumbo early in the morning was reasonable and so was Its a Small World. 10 minutes. The train was a walk on. So was the monorail. Pinocchio walk on. Sleeping Beauty's castle was fun but crowded. Toontown was mad crazy but some fun. Wish we had more time for it. The kids loved it. The carousel at night was beautiful. I got two magical pictures of my kids on it. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was great and Space Mountain Galaxy during the Halloween party was also great according to my husband. Nemo was also fun during the Halloween party. Never mad it to Splash but Pirates was our final ride of the night at the Halloween Party. We seemed to get more done that night than in the morning the other two mornings. Princess Fantasy Faire was super busy. If the line is more than 10 people. Try another time. It chewed up 45 minutes of time at least, but we made a good friend from there. It was worth it at the end. The princesses helpers were very nice especially Masen and you get to see all three princesses. However if you are more than 15 people behind. You will probably have a switch like we did. We had Tiana, Belle, and Ariel. We were going to have Mulan, Snow White, and Jasmine (I think). A better way to spend your time is to hop over the California Adventure and book a character dining. The food is good and we got everyone except Mulan, Jasmine. and Pocahantus. There was so much to do and the park was so busy that we missed a few things. Could not find the fast pass or entrance to Roger Rabbit even though we were right there. The Astroblasters were insanely busy so we skipped that too. Next time we will allot a little more time to Disneyland and hopefully our son who is only 22 months will get to enjoy the park more as he won't be so little and he'll be able to last longer before nap time. Oh almost forgot to mention meeting Woody at the Halloween trick or treat. Totally cool guy! I love Woody and my son dressed up as him. We got his autograph as most of his had been signed by the girl characters who gave him lots of love, but he's a rough tough boy who adores Woody. Woody spent special time with him and signed his autograph book and made sure we got a family picture with my son looking right at the Photopass guy. We got a couple boos mostly from the parents that did the same thing. Woody made sure to ignore it and gave my son a hug and hi five. He was so starstruck he could hardly talk. Also can't forget our totally awesome experience at Bippity Boppity Boutique. If you are questioning whether or not you should do this the answer is yes. Mom's and Dad's this is a great opportunity to treat your kid like a princess and she'll remember it forever. The hairdo stays for quite a while. Like it probably would've lasted more than 24 hours but I had to wash her hair. She loved it especially when we did it right before the Halloween party. The dresses are really really gorgeous and fit well and the pictures are professional quality. Its like going to Glamour Shots but she gets the royal treatment. Every girl does whether its just hair or the whole works. The fairy god mothers in training are fantastic. One gave me a tip where to find the woody hat we'd been searching everywhere for and we ended up getting a sheriffs badge too for my son's costume. Also our fairy god mother in training stayed in character the whole time. She was so awesome. I want to say her name was Tamara. Very sweet lady. Also if you select this experience. You get your photos right away and they will go on photopass. Bring cash if you want to tip for fairy god mother. They don't accept credit card for the tips. They do a great job and the dress is not a Walmart dress. Its quality made. The CM at Disney are especially sweet to Special Needs. I just had to whisper to Goofy about speech delay and he completely understood. He sat my daughter down and opened her book up. He took the time to let her say what she wanted to say. Thanks to Goofy, Woody, Fairy Godmother in training. Thanks to all of the characters for the meet and greets on main. We loved them so much.",1
25573,Disneyland is the cleanest attraction you can go to in California. It is a wonderful place to visit. Iv'e been there probably 15 plus times and will continue to go. Don't forget to see the Fantasmic parade on the water. It's a must see.When you come out of Pirates go to your right and get yourself a yummy bread bowl full of clam chowder. You need to go to Disney more than one day. Well worth get a multi day park hopper pass.,1
25574,"We needed the three day Disney Pass with the early morning included , there was so much to see and do. Best attractions. 1 World of Color. 2 Star Tours. 3. California Dream Roller coaster. For my daughter World of Color was the best attraction of our three week holiday. Drinking fountains great, very clean and tidy, fantastic for disabled people. Can not speak highly enough of the professional staff. ",1
25576,"I visit Disneyland at least once a month.  I have been with children teenagers young adults and elderly people.  There is something for everyone.  The parks are always clean and the foliage is always beautiful.  But is Disney, who doesn't know how great this place is?  :)",1
25519,"I recently took my boyfriend to Disneyland for his birthday. This was his first time there. Needless to say he had a wonderful time! This place is not just for kids, as soon as you walk thru the entrance you lose yourself in the magic, wonder and awe of this happy place! It happen to be Halloween time when we were there, the decorations are awesome! Seeing all the lil ones dressed up just added to the wonder of it all! The park is very clean and well laid out, easy transition from one land to another.Food prices are quite reasonable, and they also have a nice variety of healthy choices. Fun Fun Fun!!",1
25517,"This is the greatest place in the world to take kids and for adults to shop. Many rides, shops, eating places and much more. No matter where you live it is worth the trip and your whole family will have loads of fun.",1
25761,"We are AP holders and travel at least 6 times a year down to Disneyland.  We love everything about it.  The food, the ambiance, and most of all the rides!",1
25516,"Totally worth visiting even if you've been before. Coming from Florida, it's fun to see the original theme park and get to ride the classic Disney rides. It's worth a visit.",1
25459,"My wife and I are Southern California Annual Passholders and we go to Disneyland a few times each year. There are some changes from time to time as far as attractions but the park itself stays pretty much the same throughout the years. I highly recommend visiting the Haunted Mansion at or after Halloween to see the Nightmare Before Christmas decorations. I also recommend visiting during the Christmas season to see the various Christmas decorations around the park and the light show on the front of the It's A Small World attraction. The only negative is that the prices keep going up year after year so it is not an economical experience, especially for families.",1
25460,"I hadn't been to Disneyland in more than ten years. While it still holds the same magic as when I first went there in 1960, it's beginning to show its its age. For example, the Grand Canyon, Grand Circle tour hasn't changed in 40 years and its showing its age. The changes to the Pirates ride were great but the holiday changes to the Haunted Mansion ruined the experience. The other rides were predictable with no changes. The Innovation display wasn't worth the time. I was disappointed that the Indiana Jones ride was down for repair. In general, I think the Park needs some work. While it's a great nostalgic experience for those of us remembering Disneyland of the past, it has seen better times and needs some updating if it's going to keep attracting the next generation.",1
25461,"There were at least three or four rides closed, to include It's a Small World and the Indiana Jones ride. The Peter Pan ride  you can hardly see the city lights below now  is London having a brown out? Part of the time they were filming a movie and the whole Fantasyland part of the park was closed. When you pay $100 a day this seems unreasonable. Also, bring back The Swiss Family Robinson tree and jettison Tarzan. Sometimes the old is better and if it wasn't broke, why mess with it? As for Captain E O, that felt very dated and kind of creepy. ",1
25462,"Who doesn't love Disney? Great time with family! They say 50 characters or more, so I'll be a disney food cridict. Loved the green tomatoe sandwhich near Pooh ride at Disney. Espressos in both parks we're awesome. Mexican in Dsney California was good. Oriental Salad at sourdough shop was  not  good, kids sandwhich awesome; wished I had the soup.Don't forget your camera as I did. Wasted $120 on a Kodak camera in the park. Pictures turned out awful and broke my camera on a ride that made it feel worse...",1
25463,"Space Mountain, Star Tours, and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad are our favorites!  We tried the Jungle Cruise this time and enjoyed it as well.",1
25464,Great time had by the whole family. Did Magic Morning on Tuesday & did all of Fantasyland plus some in 1 hour! Always a favorite place of ours & now the kids love it as well!,1
25465,This was my family's first trip to Disneyland  following many trips to Disney World in FL. Disneyland did not disappoint. It's easy to see why Disneyland has become such a classic. They continue to  do it right  when it comes to customer service and themeing. We enjoyed every minute of our visit and can't wait to return!,1
25466,"Loved everything about it. My daughter had a great time BUT... not being able to re enter after 5pm sucked and the 8pm world of color was too late and we were exhausted. Also, we couldn't handle staying til 9pm for Fantasmic :( Our feet backs legs were sore and tired by 7pm...",1
25467,It has been over 30 years since I last visited the park. It was such a great way to spend a long weekend. My roommate and I never imagined that we would have so much fun as an adult visitor without children. I don't think we ever stopped smiling the entire weekend. Disney is the leader in customer service. No one else can even compare. I don't know how the staff does it day in and day out. The cast member in the ticket booth was so beyond helpful when we first arrived to pick up our passes. She had so many great suggestions and tips on how to maximize our visit. This may have to become a yearly visit. I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to return.,1
25468,We went the 1st week of November which was fun because we got to see both the Christmas and Halloween decorations. The only negatives were there were no fireworks because they were transitioning to the holiday show and we ended up being there on two days they were filming in the park which would have been nice to know in advance so we could have planned around them. ,1
25469,"We loved Disneyland! We loved all of the little touches this park has. We've been to Disney World many times, and this was our first trip to Disneyland. I loved seeing all the differences and taking part in all of the rides that are different. Its a Small World at Christmas is beautiful. I also really loved the food. Lots of healthy snack stations and the counter service locations served truly good food...not just burgers and junk fare. ",1
25470,"I visited Disneyland Park with my husband and 3 children (ages 12, 10 and 6) from August 30 until September 2, 2012. This was our 3rd family trip to California (we are from NJ). We expected some crowds because we were there for Labor Day Weekend and there was a Disney Half Marathon on the Sunday, but we really found the lines and crowds tolerable. On the Thursday, we were able to get so much done as the crowds were minimal. The Sunday of the Marathon was empty in the morning, but got more crowded as the afternoon and evening came around. Our favorite rides are Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Splash Mountain, and Indiana Jones Adventure. We also love all the rides in Fantasyland. Mattherhorn, despite having been redone recently, is still a very bumpy and not quite enjoyable ride. The right side track is smoother than the left. The Park was very clean and staffed very well.Don't skip the Soundsational Parade and the evening Fireworks. They are worth it!",1
25471,"You can't say enough about Disneyland. I have been there at least 50 times since it opened. I enjoy every single visit and look forward to seeing my favorite places in the park. We always take visitors from out of the area there and it is wonderful to see their enjoyment and surprise at how large it is and how much there is to see and do there. If you only get to see one thing when you visit Southern California, this should be it.",1
25473,"Went for our 4 year anniversary. Now, being a WDW girl, mainly I go at least once a year from St Louis, Disneyland IS a little different. Not quite the well oiled machine that WDW is but fun nonetheless. The Indiana Jones ride was down which was a BIG kick in the butt to us but everything else was working that we wanted to see. The NBC haunted mansion was to die for! The halloween party was VERY crowded on Oct 28th but we still got lots of candy. the lines are long but there are several stations of candy in each line that we were in. dont forget to ask for the apples or craisins either! Its extra booty on top of candy! : )",1
25474,"What is there to say...the original park and still full of magic. My third time here over the last 22 years and my wifes first. Although the park is small compared to Walt Disney World, it is still full of great rides, sights and sounds. The fireworks of an evening and also Fantasmic are shows that cannot be missed if you go. Also make sure to meet Mickey, tucked away in Toontown at the back of the park!",1
25458,This is truly the happiest place on earth. The price keeps going up but it is well worth it. We went for my wife   s birthday and it was her first time. We both were like kids again. We had a great time and the fireworks show was a great way to end the night. We hope to be going again very soon as it brings a lot of joy and good times to our life.,1
25456,"Take heed of all the warnings, there will be queues. Unless you go in the off season! Our family went for a week in late October and all the predictions of lengthy waits for popular rides did not transpire. The flip side of this is that a number of rides were closed for maintenance, including the iconic  It's a small world  which was being prepared for Christmas. A small price to pay given we were able to get onto popular rides in less than 5 minutes.When we did have to queue for the very popular rides, but the Disney park designers and cast members have got it all under control   there are always distractions to keep you amused. For instance, while waiting to get into Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters you get entertaining breifings from the Little Green Men, Zurg, and Buzz himself. While waiting to greet Mickey Mouse, there is plenty of memorabilia to examine.It all stems from a philosophy of keeping the customer (or guests as they call them) happy   the employees (called Cast Members) are incredibly helpful and had the full pixie dust treatment   how they stop them getting cynical after a million people have been through the Jungle Cruise each day is beyond me! The other thing to remember is that there is a lot of walking and standing involved. You can hire a stroller for the day, but if you can it's better to bring your own to save yourself $12 a day and the 'which one of those green strollers is mine' moments.I know some people think the older rides are a bit tired, but I think it would be a mistake to view them this way, the classic rides may seem a bit dated but they are important parts of the park for people like me who went 30 years ago and have now returned with my kids. My two kids nominated some of the classic rides as among their favourites, including the monorail and Dumbo flyers.The other tip I would give is that the snacks at the concession stands are not worth it   you can spend $8 on a hotdog or for a couple of dollars more you can get a whole plate of far tastier food at one of the restaurants.Overall, a must do thing that should be on the bucket list   either here or another park in Florida, Asia or Europe",1
25455,"On The morning of Nov. 08th, we came to Disneyland for our early morning entry to the park. We stood in line for ten minutes and were making headway to the front. ONLY to find out that the line for the 4 day Park Hopper passes was on the complete opposite side. So off we went into a much longer and slower moving line. The lady working the computer on entry did not have a clue what she was supposed to do and was so slow entering the data. We missed our early entry, thank you. Everyone around us was angry and frustrated. Why could you not have put clear visible signage for entry on the various gates. It is hard to see small printing from just about the entrance to California Land to Disneyland, which is where our line started after moving. We got into the park at 0958 after waiting in two lines for about an hour. It certainly was NOT the happiest place on earth. When you have 3 young children with you, it is hard to make them understand just how disorganized you are.",1
25444,We enjoyed seeing the park dressed up for christmas!!! The fireworks were so cool and the snow was a great extra touch...It's been 10 years since are last visit so much to see and do!!!,1
25437,"I am a adult that went here for the first time this year, and I was absolutly amazed!!!! I got really into it wearing mickey ears the whole time, I highly recommend going... with or without kids!!!",1
25439,"We had a brilliant time, go off season and get a park hopper ticket and you will get to see a lot more. Food very expensive but you can take in your own",1
25440,"I know a lot of people have been to this park! It is really crowded but is worth the wait. I have a pass and have been glued to it ever since. The annual passport is more worth it. Also, you can go to both parks. They also have super fun rides like: California Screamin  which is in my top three favorites  and MORE.I first got a pass to Disneyland when I was only three years oldI think a lot of you should try it out if you have never gone because this place it the happiest place on Earth!!",1
25441,What more can I say  Happiest place in the world .  4 days of nothing but happy faces.  Had the park hopper pass but was not overly impressed with California Adventure Park.  Can't wait to go again.,1
25442,Disneyland will always and forever more continue to delight the whole family and stay on the cutting edge of what family theme parks are all about. Our whole family has enjoyed this fun park for over 30 years. We booked our Disney vacation with Get A Trip.com,1
25443,"Was a Beautiful experience. We went on a the weekend just before thanks giving. The lines weren't too bad getting into everything, and the staff were all very helpful and accommodating.You HAVE to go and watch the fireworks. It was so beautiful I cried!! Will definitely be taking our kids there in years to come!",1
25446,"My husband and I went to DIsneyland for 4 days in October 2012. I used to live in Garden Grove and went to Disneyland quite often, but I haven't been back since October 2001. We had a great time and spent time at Disneyland Park and California Adventure. California Adventure is definitely our favorite of the two parks. California Screamin' (roller coaster), Tower of Terror , Soarin' Over California (our favorite attraction in both parks) and the new Cars Land were at the top of our list! Cars Land is very well done and must be seen especially at night. The lighting on the red rocks is spectacular! World of Color is a MUST see also! Disneyland was fun but mostly for families with young children. We still enjoyed Star Tours and Space Mountain, but California Adventure caters to older children, teenagers and adults. Disneyland corporation still knows how to take care of it's visitors. Both parks were spotless and all the employees are very friendly and helpful. It's still a very MAGICAL place!",1
25453,"I found myself with an entire free Wednesday after completing a business meeting in Lancaster in the Mojave Desert. I've always found LA people to be very friendly and gregarious. I received no shortage of sightseeing suggestions. Most were high brow (museums, gardens, galleries, etc). I settled for middle brow   Disneyland   and set off on the 2 1 2 hour, arduous trek to Anaheim at 7:30 a.m. After surviving I 5 morning commuter traffic, and convincing myself I made a huge mistake and wondering how ANYONE could choose to live in such a sprawling, congested, blighted city, I arrived at the park around 10:00 a.m. I got off to a rocky start when some very assertive woman with two pre teen brats accused me of jumping the line while queuing outside the main gate (at age 60?? I wasn't THAT anxious to get into the Magic Kingdom! I was appalled and deigned not to respond. Idiot). Once inside the park, I migrated toward Adventureland and made a clockwise tour of the park. The last time I visited was at least 35 years ago. Having arrived on a Wednesday in early November, I did not encounter the heat, crowds or frustration my nieces and nephews related to me of their Disneyland experience a few months before, in August. I fully intended to just tour the park but the lines were so short (5 10 minute waiting period for almost all rides) I succumbed to the inner child and rode all the attractions that appealed to me, some several times! The only drawback: Finding myself in line to ride a kiddie attraction with the Diaper Crowd in Mickey's Toon Town; very embarrassing; I had to backtrack and exit in the wake of screaming toddlers and harried mothers:  You said you wanted to go on this ride and that's what we're going to do!  The weather was gorgeous; low mid 70s. All in all, it turned out to be a great choice to fill a day. My only major gripe: The food prices are ridiculously expensive. The admission price alone is very steep, plus the $15.00 parking ticket   why does Disney need to be so greedy with their food prices? (Answer: Because they can). I survived on an apple and meat kabob all day, both purchased at the park, until feeling faint and ill after the 3D Star Tours ride (fun but I suffered motion sickness). I bought a soup and sandwich   not especially caring about the price   at some nice restaurant on Main Street. It was worth it. Now I found myself hanging with the Other Diaper Crowd   the ones wearing Depends; waiting for the peppier, younger family members to return from the Matterhorn and Thunder Mountain, while sitting in the glow of early 20th century lanterns and piped in nostalgic music ( Daisy, Daisy! ); very surreal. About this time, I decided to head home (a hotel near LAX). I could have spent another two hours but I had seen and done all the things I wanted to. After leaving the park, I walked around Downtown Disney   very attractive retail restaurant district   and toured the Grand California Hotel lobby   very impressive. Took the tram back to the enormous parking garage and drove through evening commuter traffic to LAX. Fun day. Will I return? Heck no. Next time I'm in LA, I want to visit the Huntington Museum and Gardens in Pasadena. I doubt anyone there will accuse me of bucking the line!",1
25447,"Don't miss a chance to go to Disneyland if given the opportunity. It is an amazing place to take your family, or just go on your own. Highlights are the rides of course. The ever popular Peter Pan ride (head there first upon arrival), the parades, the shows, and the weather. I could write a book about my experience but just want to say go and have fun. The week days are the least busy. Tuesday especially.",1
25448,Again Disneyland is so much fun for any age. We went as soon as the park opened and did not have to wait long for any rides. Single rider lines are great if your travelling party are old enough to go on their own. Just remember a meeting point at the end. Splash Mountain ride was about 50 minute wait   single rider line only 2 minutes. We got so much more done!!,1
25449,"Disneyland Rocks !For young and old, big and small     it's the happiest place on earth! Come build memories with your family that last a lifetime as you discover the wonder of this magical, fantastical world. When you enter one of the Lands that comprise Disneyland Park, stories come to life around you, immersing you in tales from some of your favorite Disney films",1
25450,We got a 5 day hopper and we like to sleep in so 2 hours after the parks open there are not huge lines at the gate. Also starting the rides when everyone is looking for food means the lines are shorter. Both kids 8 & 10 (tall for there age) were able to go on every ride that they wanted. Lockers for jackets as the temperature cooled down really helped.,1
25451,"First time my husband had been to Disneyland. We travelled as a couple and we had a terrific time. It is the Happiest Place on Earth. We were able to hit up every large ride being that the lineups average was only 15 20 min. Plus saw those original rides   Small world, spinning teacups,etc. A little disappointed that Indiana Jones was closed but nice to see that Disney keeps up with there regular maintenance in the off season. First time I had seen Disney all set up for Christmas. They do a terrific job! The fireworks were also Christmas themed and a nice surprise at the end. Thanks Disney for allowing us big kids to be kids again!",1
25452,The park hopper passes are worthwhile here as opposed to DisneyWorld due to the close proximity of Disneyland and the California Adventure park.,1
25475,Take a trip back to the world of fantasy when you visit this iconic theme park and see your childhood memories flood back. No matter your age it is impossible not to get swept up in teh magic of Disneyland. February is a very good month to vist just be careful to avoid school holidays and if you can pay a visit also at night the park looks fabulous.,1
25476,"We went with family, including a three year old for her first Disneyland visit. We only could spend the afternoon there and went to just this one area. Seeing some attractions through the eyes of a little one is a treat. She loved the  Ariel  ride (Little Mermaid). We loved the  Soaring  over California, but especially loved  Cars . Of course, my husband and I are fans of the first  Cars  movie, so we were in our element seeing Radiator Springs, Cadillac Range, Luigi's, Flo's, etc. But, the highlight was seeing Mater, Lightening McQueen, and Red in person (well, in molded polymers). Great family vacation destination, or just for a day. Loved it.",1
25477,"There is soooooo much to visit... cant see it all in 1 day. Since I live in tustin we did not book a hotel out there. So had to make it a 1 day visit. Its a lovely place, its fun to watch the toon character roaming around, posing for snaps with kids and giving autographs. Great rides, has lots and lots and lots for kids. Loved fantasmic and the parade.. was fun meeting mickey at his house though waiting for your turn is an agony. Its another world altogether, a must go if you visit california",1
25508,"I have been to Disneyland on many times, going about once a year (more if I can manage). I have been with friends, with my significant other, with school trips, and even once on my own. If you think going to a theme park by yourself would be the most depressing thing in the world, normally I would agree but at Disney, they keep you so engaged and entertained, you feel like the whole party is just for you. Top things never to miss at Disney are the fireworks and the shows. Disney makes everything seem so easy and flawless.Now, many people may say Disney is expensive, has long lines, and crowded. This is true, as it is for all theme parks. However, I maintain that Disney gives you more for the money than any other park, between the rides, character meet and greets, shows, parades and atmosphere they provide. While you are line, Disney keeps you engaged and does their absolute best to keep rides functioning and going as fast as possible (especially compared to Six Flags, who does not manage lines or the rides at all but goes through the motion leading to hour long rides on everything). And as far as being crowded, you can find some nice quiet spots if you need. Check out around Cinderella's castle for a nice break with some lemonade, or grab a bit at one of the eateries at non peak times for great service and decent food. I could go on forever about Disney, but all I really need to say is go. And if you have already been, go again. It gets better the more times you see it.",1
25502,"WE LOVE IT!   Try to go when the lines aren't too long.  Great place.  It is clean, and rides normally run smoothly and often.  We took the kids there in the 1980s and we still go there.   Great rides!",1
25503,"I went with my girlfriend and we loved it! Went when I was young and it was just as good as an adult. Some scary rides, great atmosphere and a must do if you are in LA. Try to go on a weekday as it can get too busy on weekends",1
25504,"3 very long days were spent at both parks, great fun for all ages. Staff were super friendly, the place was soooo clean.",1
25505,"Disneyland isn't just for kids, I loved every moment!! It was a childhood dream come true and I will never forget it!",1
25506,"Disney was great. We visited during Halloween and it was fabulous, the decorations were very festive and I LOVED the haunted mansion   Nightmare before Christmas theme!!",1
25507,"Fun for all ages, bring your cash and wear some good walking shoes. Don't forget to bring zip lock bags for wet rides and it got chilly in June so bring a jacket or buy a $40 sweatshirt. The worst thing about it is all the strollers. The best thing about it is everything else!",1
25509,"The new Cars Ride was very thrilling but the ride goes very fast, literally, so it's kind of a disappointment for the wait. Everything else was just Disney perfect as usual. Fast passes times wisely make the waiting in line very reasonable. The kids loved it! we'll definitely go back again and again and again and again............",1
25499,"We have gone 4 times now and all I can say is a bad day at Disney is still a great day! Bad meaning big line ups and high heat or rain. We've taken our kids from age 1.5 to 7 and they've loved every minute of it and over the 4 years loved it in different ways each time. It's clean, safe, family fun, Yes it's overpriced and the line ups are long for the good rides but we've had some special moments with our kids that you can't put a price on and that is what Disney is really about!",1
25510,"With a group ranging from age 6 to 70, there was something for everyone. From the security guard at the entrance 'Welcome to a world of awesome' to all the staff who congratulated our birthday girl, there was a great atmosphere. The crowds during the week were much more manageable than the weekend chaos, especially for wait times. There was a greater range of food than we were expecting, including fresh fruit for sale.",1
25511,"Just as good as 20 years ago. The Pirates of Carribean & Splash Mountain rides still favorites! The whole Park is so clean & well looked after, beautiful gardens everywhere.",1
25512,"Not all cars on rides were running, so some lines.  But the Mickey's Halloween Party was amazing our two granddaughters got tones of candy and scares.",1
25513,Loved the park again. Story Book land and Indiana Jones were closed. park was not very busy since everyone was at DCA at Cars Land. Still the Happiest place on Earth.,1
25514,"I took my mother, boyfriend, and 2 children (ages 4 and 11) on a Sunday. It was not crowded at all and the weather was beautiful. We really enjoyed ourselves. The lines were fairly short, but the ones that were longer seemed to move quickly. We stopped and ate at the restaurant across from the castle and their fried chicken, string beans, and mashed potatoes was fabulous! I want to go back here just to get the food. The parade was spectacular as well. The only downside is that some of the rides were closed due to maintenance.",1
25515,"Was what we expected. We were off season so line ups were not bad. Rides are old but still fun. Food was over priced but was still good. Park hopper pass is worth it so you can come and go to the different parks any time you want. We did not get early admission to the park but did not really need it. We ate a few of the downtown Disney restaurants and the food was good, little pricey. Over all was good.",1
25500,"We visited here on 23rd October 2012 and were pleasantly surprised how empty it was.They cater for the disabled guest to a high standard with good parking and a guest assistant card. i cant stand for anymore than 10 minutes without extreme discomfort and am registered disabled. Had it not been for the card I would not have been able to enjoy the day with my family.Upon arrival go to guest relations inside main gate. I had a letter from my doctor,explained what my condition prevented me from doing and that was it. Well done Disney,the kids had an amzing day.",1
25498,We were at the park when the endeaver went over head what a great thing to see.the park kept us informed on it's arrival So glad we did not miss this once in a lifetime sight,1
25478,"It's still the most magical place in the world. Walt Disney World resort and all of it's offerings come in as a close second. What can I say, I have been in love with the Mouse Park ever since I was 3....so that's 51 years of love.",1
25487,"I was not truly amazed by DisneyLand in LA...I visited Disney World in FL first and because of that visit, my expectations were quite high! I know that the LA Land has limited space and no where to expand...to me it looks as though it's an old outdated version of Florida's Park. I think the price is way too high for Disneyland, out of sight for most folks with a couple of kids! At least when you pay the price in Florida you feel like your getting your money's worth of attractions!",1
25479,"We had three day park hopper tickets for Disneyland and California Adventure Park. I thought Disneyland was kind of old and outdated but the kids loved it so if they're happy, then I'm happy. The lines are really long for the rides and attractions and everything is expensive from the food to the t shirts and everything in between. The corn dogs are awesome though and I would pay the inflated entrance fee just for another hand dipped corn dog. It's best to go on a weekday during the off season and show up early to enjoy the park. The parade is really cool but they need to update the characters as there are a lot of new Disney characters that the kids want to see. All of the characters are from my childhood and not for the kids today. I also wish they had more chances to get your picture with the characters. They appear randomly and the lines get long fast.",1
25480,"Its Disneyland   what is there not to like ;)I must confess I was a little bit disappointed with Disneyland, I think the reason was because I have been to Disneyworld, and knew what to expect, so was shocked at how small it was here :(I love Disney and I loved Disneyland, it's great for a day out (if you live close by), or for a short visit to do both parks. We pretty much did all the rides in a day, and then went back for the Halloween party (which was an extra $69 each!!).If you have the option I would chose WDW over Disneyland, but if you haven't been to either then go here first, as there is still lots of Disney magic and you can get your Disney Fix. The parades are great, the characters are awesome. We did a character breakfast and it was so much fun. I'm 35 and I was just as excited as the kids to get my photo taken with the characters.I believe they offer discounts to So Cal residents   what about us Nor Cal residents?Make sure you take lots of $$$ as you will spend it   $9 for a turkey leg (and it wasnt that great!), Mickey ice creams are great, and I hear the pretzels are good (but never got to try one).If you have a water bottle with you take it in and you will save a small fortune.",1
25481,"A classic, what else is there to say?  Everything is always amazing at the happiest place on earth. A favorite place for our family for countless years.",1
25482,"November is a good month. Lines were short and the weather was temperate. Enough people but not like summer. Even the new attraction, Cars Land, was not particularly crowded.",1
25483,I just love Dizzyland!  Going mid week in Nov. is wonderful.  18 rides in one day.  Crowds were at a minimum.  Maybe 20 min. wait at the very most.  Nightmare Before Christmas Haunted Mansion is a must see.,1
25486,"Loved the Halloween decorations and Haunted Mansion, hated the crowds! We arrived on the Friday morning before Halloween and got on all the major rides we enjoy including the Haunted Mansion walked right in , and Thunder Mountain. We got fastpasses for Space Mountain and waited about 20 mins for Starwars. As usual, the later it got, the more crowded it became. By around 4PM it was too much for me because of all the people arrving for the Halloween Party.",1
25488,My family and I had the best time. It was so much fun. Just make sure you check the schedule so you don't miss the shows. We missed the shows because we didn't have the schedule.The food was horrible. So I would suggest taking your own food. They say you can't take your own food but we seen so many people with coolers inside the park. Overall it was a very nice family trip. I now want to get to a pass for the whole year.,1
25496,"I cannot wait to go back   this place is amazing. Make sure you buy the  park hopper  ticket as California Adventure Land is just as good, if not better than Disneyland!The amount if people in wheelchairs and electric carts was mindblowing. Get your fast pass   they were very useful (if you could get one that is)",1
25490,"DIsneyland is always terrific. But we invested in the extra tickets for Mickey's Halloween Party and were sooo glad we did. Firstly, DON'T buy a ticket for the park that day, then a ticket for this. You can get in at 4pm and stay till midnight most days and most of the rides are WALK ON, or a 5 minute wait. Also, don't bother buying halloween candy for trick or treaters back home, because you'll get about 30 pounds of it if you hit each of the trick or treat stations inside. Bring some plastic grocery bags to dump your candy into, the treat bags they give you don't come close to housing all the suger you will collect.Everyone was in costume, my husband was convinced that he would be the only fully grown male dressed up and he was very very wrong. Soooo fun and festive, it was the best birthday my daugher every had. ",1
25491,First time visiting was a blast. Have to buy ears no matter what your age. We went in October and lines were not bad. They have a fastpass system where you can reserve your place in line and go back when it is your time and walk right in. Saves a lot of time. I wish we had gone when the park opened so we could have seen more. Space mountain was the best ride and the Matterhorn was the worst. It was a chiropractic experience! Very expensive to get in so be prepared.,1
25492,"What can I say great as always.Some rides seemed to breakdown quite a bit. But most were up and running within the hour.Great time to visit in the offseason and during the week.They're getting ready for Christmas.Definitely buy your tickets online, at Costco or AAA. You don't need to stand in the ticket purchasing line and then the entrance line too.",1
25493,Monday's are not as busy as other days.  The queues outside will be long but disperse quickly once inside.  Apart from school holidays of course ... the it's nuts!!,1
25494,"We took our daughters 11 and 19. and spent the day roaming the park spending lots of money. Everything is overpriced, but just pretend it's Vegas and you are throwing money down a slot machine. The kiddos will never forget it. Even my 19 year old daughter enjoyed taking photos with the Disney princesses and Mickey Mouse. Totally worth every penny for their happiness.",1
25495,"As a 27 year old male, I have no shame in saying I absolutely love Disneyland. Like a fine wine, it always seems to get better with age. Disneyland is one of the few places where adults can be kids again and relive some of that innocence, excitement and magic that inevitable escapes us as we grow older. I don't think there is much that I can add that has not already been said. Having that in mind, if you have never been, do yourself a favor and GO! If you have, GO AGAIN!",1
25597,"I had not been to Disneyland for over 18 years and didn't give it too much thought since we used to go alot when we lived in California when I was younger. However, bringing my own kids was a whole new experience, and a worthwhile one. We came here off season during the week and were able to get early admission into the park since we stayed at a Disney Hotel. We went on alot more rides than I thought we would be able to go on and my husband and I could each fit two kids with us, since they are small. A couple of the rides were a little scary even though they were supposed to be for little kids though. My toddler got freaked out in the Nemo submarine and Mr. Toad's ride so keep that in mind if you have a more sensitive child. Also, the one ride I was going to go on by myself was closed for refurbishing so that is good to check online before you go there if you had your heart set on something. My husband and I made use of the parent swap pass on a couple of rides which worked out well. We had one umbrella stroller for our toddler but were going to get a stroller for our 4 year old twins since there was so much walking. We were already in the park when we were told that the stroller rental was outside the main entrance. It wasn't super obvious. We didn't get one since they don't rent out double strollers. Also, we were told that you could buy sunscreen everywhere, wherever you looked. We looked just about everywhere and found one gift shop that had it. Was really strange since it was so hot there. We couldn't bring alot on the plane so decided to buy it when we got there. All of us are very fair skinned so sunscreen was a must! Wearing hats kept us alot cooler as well. The temperature was in the 90s. All in all, we had a great time and never had to wait too long in a line even though it seemed like alot of people were there. I definitely think going off season during the week is your best bet if you are able to and staying at one of the Disney Hotels so you are close to the park and can get early admittance. Lots of fun!",1
25598,"We go to disneyland about every 2 3 years in the off season. We have enjoyed light crowds in the October and January months. This year was completely different, however. Disneyland was PACKED, i mean PACKED. I asked an employee why this was so crowded, she mentioned that since the addition of Cars Land, crowds have been amazingly huge. So just be prepared if you go in the offseason in the near future, be prepared to wait in lines. ",1
25599,"I was here for 15 hours and couldn't stop smiling. It really is the happiest place on earth, and I didn't mind lining up for the rides. Staff service was excellent as was park cleanliness. It was absoloutely magical.",1
25600,My husband & I were not looking forward to our recent trip to Disneyland with our 5 y o daughter as it didn't like much of a 'vacation' but boy were we wrong! From the moment we walked through the gates we were instantly caught up in the magic of it all & even decided to stay an extra day at the park. Everything is just so beautiful & fun and the serivce you receive from every single staff member you interact with is top notch. We were pleasantly surprised at all variety of food options available & it wasn't too hard to find something healthy even for snacks. Our only suggestion would be to not visit during the Halloween season as the park closes early for an Halloween party which is an additional fee & the park gets very busy during the last few hours as all the party go ers are allowed in early.,1
25704,"The last time here in '96, there was only one park, with an enormous carpark at the front.The two parks do seem to compliment each other, with the original one still being the better of the two.The only dislike is that we didn't get offered much of a seniors discount, which didn't make us too bothered, but it would be a great incentive if they did so. Universal Studios in Singapore gives almost 50% discount.",1
25705,"This is a longer than average review, but I feel covers all bases, and may answer any questions you may have. If you take the time to read it, I think you will feel it was worthwhile. If you are familiar with Disney's Magic Kingdom park, located at the Disney World Resort in Orlando, there are only minor differences between that park and Disneyland. The overall layout between the two parks are very similar, with the castle in the center of the park, surrounded by the various  lands . One major difference between the two parks is the overall size. Disneyland sits on 85 acres of land, while Magic Kingdom is nearly double the size, at 142 acres. However, the nice thing about Disneyland (besides the nostalgic value of being the original Disney Park), is that all of the major attractions found at Magic Kingdom are also at Disneyland. There are also a couple other big attractions from the other Disney World parks, such as Star Tours (which can be found at Disney World's Hollywood Studios), also can be found at Disneyland. Therefore, you can have nearly the same experience at Disneyland (if not better), with much less walking required. As far as attractions go, which can be enjoyed by adults and older children, Disneyland offers the following: * Space Mountain   an indoor roller coaster in the dark* Splash Mountain   a dark ride with a theme of the classic movie  Song of the South , which doubles as a log flume ride* Haunted Mansion   a dark ride with a haunted house theme. Note   I found the Disneyland version better than the Magic Kingdom version * Big Thunder Mountain Railroad   a semi mild roller coaster that goes through a mountain * Matterhorn Bobsleds   another milder roller coaster type ride, that goes through a mountain, which features an encounter with the YetiThere are also some attractions which can be enjoyed by the entire family such as: * Jungle Cruise   a boat ride through a jungle setting, which features animatronic animals* Pirates of the Carribean   a dark ride on a boat, featuring animatronic Pirates* Disneyland Railroad  A train ride around the perimeter of the park, which also contains some hidden areas which you do not see elsewhereLastly there are several attractions which are geared towards younger children, which are certainly tolerable for their parents. Included are many typical rides you would find at an Amusement Park or Fair (such as the carousel, tea cups, etc). In addition to those are several dark rides with Disney themes, including: * It's a small world * Mr. Toad's Wild Ride * Peter Pan's Flight* Snow White's Scary Adventure * Alice in Wonderland And Many MoreOne of the other things that is nice about Disneyland, are the above average dining options, for a theme park. The options range from a simple turkey leg to fine dining. Pricing for many options are not really all that far off what you would pay at a typical theme park either. Expect to pay $10   $15 per meal, for your standard meals (fine dining and character meals of course are much higher in price). Some of the more noteable meal options are in the New Orleans Square area. Unfortunately, one of the downfalls of Disneyland's food and beverage division, is there are no drink refills available. You can purchase one of the expensive souvenir cups, but there are no refills available with it. On a positive note though, you are permitted to bring food and non alcoholic beverages in the park with you, which can be a big money saver. Another thing that sets Disneyland apart from the competition, is the fastpass system, which is free of charge. While other parks offer a premium service at an etpxtra cost, for reduced waiting lines, this service is included with your regular admission. There are only certain attractions which have fastpass lines, and you can only have one fastpass at a time, but it will not cost you an extra penny. You simply insert your admission card pass into a kiosk at the attraction entrance, and are given a fastpass ticket with a return appointment time. It should be noted though, that a limited amount of fastpasses are given out for each time interval, and the more popular attractions may have all fastpass handed out for the entire day quite early. It does take some strategy to get the most out of this system. I recommend at minimum two days for this park, in order to experience everything. We spent two full days here during the offseason, in order to get through everything, and did a select few rides twice. If visiting during the peak season you may need even more than 2 days, but it's hard to say for sure, as the hours of operation are longer in the peak season than during the offseason. The  Magic Morning  hours are a bit better sounding than they actually are. Many 3 day hopper passes now include one day (of your choice) for Magic Morning admission. This means you get to enter the park one hour earlier, than the general public, however there are two catches to this. The first being, that so many guests have this option, that you still have to wait in a long line just to get through the admission turnstiles. If you show up a few minutes before the early admission time, expect to wait at least 30 minutes in line to get into the park. The second catch is actually a little more important, and that is that the majority of the park is not accesible, during the Magic Morning hours. The only areas that are accessible are Tommorowland and Fantasyland. The other areas are completely inaccessible, as they have gates closing them off. throughout the day the lines for the attractions in Tommorowland and Fantasyland, really are not that bad (especially if you take advantage of the fastpass system or single rider line), so you may want to consider using your early morning hour to get a headstart to getting in line for a more popular attraction first thing. For example: if you want to get on Splash Mountain without a long wait, consider waiting at the closed gate which separates Fantasyland and Frontierland, and once it opens at normal opening time, you will have a head start on the walk to the attraction entrance. If you are going to use the Magic Morning hour, as positioning for a head start towards the other attractions, you may want to use the Magic Morning option on your last day attending the park. That way you know which particular attraction you will want to head towards first, in order to avoid a line which you were turned off by, during normal operating hours. Also note that if you have a Magic Morning hour available via any way other than staying at an onsite resort, that it most likely only works on Disneyland Park (and will not work for California Adventure Park). This is not something that is necessarily advertised well, and you don't want to make the mistake of planning to use your extra hour to get to an attraction in California Adventure Park, or you will have an unpleasant surprise. Lastly, the nightime spectacular show  Fantasmic!  is a must see, if it is on the schedule, during your visit. I actually have not seen this show at Disneyland, as they only show it on a limited basis during the offsaeson, but have seen it at Disney World's Hollywood studio. These nighttime shows do tend to be very popular, so require you to arrive up to an hour early, in order to get a good viewing position. If dining packages are being offered, you may want to consider that, as they do not cost any extra (than your meal would normally) and provide you guaranteed viewing of he show.",1
25706,"Disneyland is a wonderful place. I recently came here with my fiance, and we did the 2 day Park Hopper ticket, and didn't feel overcharged at all. There is so much to do at Disneyland that there is no way to get bored. We really enjoyed Haunted Mansion and the Halloween decor, as well as classic elements like seeing the Princesses and the Soundsational Parade. We also thoroughly enjoyed that Disneyland is geared a bit more towards younger children, but California Adventure is a bit more adult, so with both parks you can get the best of both worlds. Truly fantastic, overall.",1
25707,We branched out and decided to eat at a couple of places we had not tried before  Carnation Cafe (twice breakfast and lunch) and Tortilla Jo's(dinner) and we were glad we did.  The food selections were outstanding.,1
25708,Still as I remembered.  Space Mountain much improved.  Bummed that Indiana Jones was closed.  Space Tours was just awesome.  Just love the cleanliness.  Wish it has been less crowded but we still had a blast.,1
25709,"3rd time visiting and still loads of fun.  New rides always been added.  Some rides were closed for maintenance is the only downside  Get a ticket with FastPass, makes life easier.  Food has improved, more variety and healthy options.",1
25711,"Everything Disney is just amazing! The kids had a ball, so did we! We purchased a 4 day hopper pass that got us access to both parks and it was great and sufficient. If your itinerary allows it avoid the park on weekends, as all the locals are there and the queues were much longer.",1
25712,We were able to avoid the crowds.  Use fast pass and try to visit twice.  One time vist may leave you stressed over what you don 't see.,1
25713,The Magic Kingdom still lives up to its name.  I've lived nearby my whole life and every visit still amazes me.  Disney is themepark done right!,1
25714,Disneyland is smaller and WAY easier to navigate with little kids than Disneyworld. We LOVED our visit there and can not wait to return.,1
25715,"Disney never gets old. I saw people of all ages enjoying themselves here. My mother & I visited on a nice day in September during the school holidays. We were so surprised by the fact that the lines weren't long at all, they did start to pick up throughout the day but we were satisfied by the amount of rides attractions we covered by the end of it all. This is the third disney park I've been to and I still love it. The food was average tasting with inflated prices which was expected. I loved that disney railway which could take you around the park to all the main locations as you get tired of walking so far and travelling back and forth to use your fast pass. My favourite is still the space mountain! Recommend to all!!!",1
25716,"Other than the temperature (95   104 degrees) it was great. Even with the temp so high the cast members were actually pretty cheerfull.One member at a Souvenir stand (Caitlin) next to Matterhorn went WAY out of her way to help us find a good place for the fireworks. As she was helping us during her break she found out it was our grandaughters birthday the next day...she told us to wait while she made some phone calls. Upon returning we discovered she had gotten us special seating the next night to view the fireworks. It was totally fantastic.The only downside we had was Space Mountain's modification to a Halloween concept where it was totally dark, no stars or planets   just quick glimpses of some grotesque figures and faces   it wasn't even the same ride and it was a downer. They should just do the ride changes at the Mansion and leave Tomorrowland alone...opinion.",1
25717,Went in 2nd week of Sept. Lineup waits maybe 5 min except cars. The shopping in the park was a little expensive but you only come once in a while,1
25718,Disneyland at halloween time is a must see!! Decorations are amazing. A little busy but well worth it.,1
25719,"We just got back from Anaheim California and spent three days of our trip at Disneyland and California Adventure. We are huge Disney fans and many people told us we would be disappointed because we have been to Disney World so many times. We weren't disappointed, we LOVED it!! Yes, it has a different feel than Florida but same great Disney. The park is smaller so it felt more personal, the rides are great, very clean and the waiting areas for most of the rides are covered and provide some shade while you're waiting. Food is very good and there is a different variety to chose from. For the space Disney has to work with they have made the very most of this space. We loved the horse drawn carriage and the Omnibus they had to ride through the park. I just can't say enough about Disney, if you don't smile when you walk in the gate, well, maybe it's just not for you, Disneyland provided as much magic and smiles as Disney World with smaller crowds and shorter wait times. We will definitely be going back!!",1
25703,Buy at least a 3 day park hopper. We always get a 5 day park hopper. BEst time to get on those popular rides is just before closing.,1
25702,After several trips to Walt Disney World I was concerned that Disneyland might be a disappointment. It wasn't! We had a great time and the weather was amazing. Lots to do for kids of all ages :),1
25701,"Overall preferred Disneyland to  new  California theme park, but that was partly nostalgia. Pirates of the Caribbean still ticks all the boxes, followed closely by Small World and Splash Mountain. In California Adventure, Soaring over California is a must see and children loved the Bug World.",1
25691,"What can say about Disneyland that hasn't been said a million times over. The rides awesome, the food awesome, the ambience awesome. We did get our kids caricatures done by an AWESOME guy names John in New Orleans Square. Well worth the money spent. Having your vacation immortalized like that. The only negatives would be how the  Corporation  operates. One cast member says to make a sign for the Jedi Academy and security says its too big when you arrive with it. Its okay though if you cut it in half. The other maddening thing was when we went to watch Aladdin's show. My 2 year old started to cry so I took him into the stairwell to calm him down. A castmember Ryen told me I was to leave immediately as I was disturbing the show. Now I wasn't planning on re entering the theater but I do know I wasn't disrupting the show as I couldn't even hear it going on. So that kinda ticked me off. Will I go again to Disneyland. Of course. Did it change my opinion of the Corporation. Of course. It also affected my spending in the park after. One major plus is the Mint Juleps and the beignets in New Orleans Square. Heavenly. They are must haves. Your welcome in advance.",1
25683,The hostess and host were very accommodating to my handicapped husband and always courteous. They went out of the way for our family with our needs.,1
25684,"Always the great park, however, doesn't seem to have any slow periods.  Crowds were huge. The economy cannot be too bad!",1
25685,"The creativity that went into building this amusement park is amazing. Most rides are for children, but there are a handful that are for adults. Although, if you have neck problems I would advise to not go on Space Mountain as it is a high speed rollercoaster. This rollercoaster is in the dark and you cannot see which way you will be turning and you can feel the g forces when you go around the corners. Thunder mountain was awesome. Never went on the Matterhorn bobsleds as we ran out of time. We only had one day, but I would suggest either two days or figure out where you want to go before you get there and be there early. Also, take advantage of the Fastpass. We went in September when all the children are back in school so it wasn't too busy, but busy enough for some of the lineups. Wear comfortable shoes and drink lots of water.",1
25688,We went on a monday which means shorter lines and less crowds. The prices for tickets just keep going up making a disneyland less and less affordable vacation.,1
25689,"Every one knows it is a fantastic place for entertainment and recreation.We got to Disneyland Paris, twice. But LA resort is larger and funnier! Except the hot weather of LA in summer, that urge me to say the truth: Paris was totally better. because it is Paris!Nevertheless We have such a good day in LA and never recognized the time! It was 9:30 pm when we left the Park. This is another advantage of LA to Paris. the french park closes @ 7:00 pm.I advise shortly the best items:1  Space mountain. I am afraid of roller coasters, But my daughter convinced me to have a ride. It was amazing, and also frightening. The black space makes you forget everything but your riding!2  Space Tour. It was Grate. you get to a cabin with 20 other people. and thanks of 3D technology and using powerful hydraulic jacks you experience the space tour during less than 5 minutes. The acceleration is unbelievable! just try it....3  Finding Nemo. the experience of a submarine cruise which is unrepeatable!4  Splash mountain5  Indiana Jones and ...6  Caribbean Pirates7  Mark twine Cruise8  Pete pan 9  Mono rail....Have a good time there",1
25690,"We had 3 day passes and one exciting magic morning pass, not all attractions were open but boy oh boy! the excitement between our friends and our children together made the visit to Disneyland fantastic. We had two 9 yr olds, one refused to see princesses and thought it was too baby ish, we also had a seven year old who did not want to leave, however, when we got there, she who shall not be named, could not leave. Merida was her princess of choice because she was that, um, fantastic mix of tom boy and princess. Nothing beats the Disney parade, it always chokes me up to see my favorite characters growing up( yes! I know they're not real but I'm not telling the kids that) and Fantasia was truly fantastic. There is a lot of standing around, the Indiana Jones ride broke down, but we never gave up, we paced ourselves beautifully and everything, including the ice creams we ate at every turn, culminated in the stunning fireworks display. It made every late night and achy feet, worthwhile.",1
25692,"I haven't been there in twenty years,Disneyland did not disappoint. I felt like a small child again.My sister and I are women of a certain age and were given 'Princess for a Day' buttons to wear as we entered the park, which we wore proudly. How cool is that ?",1
25700,We had a great time and my kids got life memories that will last for ever. It was a little busier than i thought it would be for this time of year but it did matter.,1
25693,"I have been to Disneyland at least 50 times. Each time i go, the grounds are cleaner than any theme park i have ever seen and i have never come accross a rude staff member. This place is amazing i will continuing to visit as often i can for the rest of my life. ",1
25694,It's Disneyland....Need I say more. One word describes this place......MAGICAL.....Firework show is the best out there.,1
25695,"We had so much fun. Star Tours is one of the best rides I've ever done. Big Thunder Mtn Railroad and Space Mtn were both excellent. We did have to wait for nearly an hour to see Rapunzel, but since that was one of the reasons for our trip, we stuck it out. I was sorry that Flynn wasn't there too. We had a great time and always recommend this park!",1
25697,"How could you not love Disneyland? You expect heat, lines and cranky humans of course but it's all weighed against the magic that is Disney. We had four days passes and used them sensibly. We came for Park Opening and left at noon to relax and unwind, we returned at 4 and stayed until Park Closing   this worked so well. We rode the popular rides during parades and just walked right on to them. Do we want to go back? Heck yeah!",1
25698,"Had a great time on our recent family vacation here. The park is kept up nicely, however, I preferred California Adventure park to Disneyland this time around. The food selection is good and the prices didn't seem too bad as far as amusement parks go. Some of the rides seemed to break down a lot and had to be closed down perodically. Also, some areas of the park become extremely crowded and hard to walk in due to the lack of open areas.",1
25699,"I had one of the greatest days of my life at this Disneyland!! It isn't the biggest but it is BIG! and it is also the original land that Walt Disney lived at with his family :)It was awesome, i loved it!!I have to say, it is hard to say which was my favorite ride. I went with my mum, and she had just as much fun as i did so your never too old :)Also, when your in  Mickey's toon town  if you line up at Mickey's Barn, you can go line up for up to maybe 10 minutes in airconditioning and get an exclusive picture with Mickey! It was the best way to see him :) and you also get to see some cool and quirky things inside his barn too! And watch some of his original cartoons while your waiting.Toon town is just really cool in general too. You get to see all the disney character's homes! and they are usually somewhere around there (for a picture opportunity).Also if you like frozen drinks, they have 'apple' frozen drinks in Toon Town and they are so yum! never tried such a good frozen drink. Only in Toon Town though! otherwise they have it in a few other places but isnt the same syrup.Best time!!!",1
25720,"First off a piece of advice if you plan to go to Disneyland   Go On A Weekday ! If you do, you have easier parking, shorter lines (sometimes no lines)   a better experience overall. I liked that Disney is always attempting to update some of the attractions, including the use of some modern technologies. Everything was worth the wait, which except for 2 attractions, was pretty short. Favorites for attractions were: Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Space Mountain and Star Tours.Have fun ! : ))",1
25722,"After a very long, very hot, very exhausting (but fun) day at Disneyland with our 4 year old twins, we managed to   accidentally   drive off leaving our  Toy Story  dolls (Woody and Buzz) on the car rooftop. Alas, the toys fell off the roof and were run over on the Disneyland exit road. So we had to return to the carpark where attendant Michael (I'm fairly sure that was his name) and his team allowed us to park close to the trolley so we could return to the Disneyland park (groan) to get replacements of Woody and Buzz. The carpark guys also managed to get us a voucher so we could replace the dolls for free   and it was great not to have to pay for the toys again. Then, mission accomplished, as we were driving back to LA, it transpired the replacement Buzz was not working!! (Groan). So we had to return to the Disneyland carpark for a third time that day. This time we were ushered right to the very front of the carpark   and we finally collected new dolls again that were all in working order. It was a scenario not dissimilar to a  Toy Story  movie plot. I have to say it was the carpark guys who stopped us parents from going completely crazy. Many thanks to the unsung heroes of the Disneyland Park   the parking team!!",1
25723,"WE LOVED THE RIDES OF COURSE!! THE FOOD WAS NASTY. I ordered a child's meal.The hamburger was the size of a silver dollar with 4 cold fries. My hubby ordered a reg hamburger. He was lucky he got 9 cold fries overdone burger and drink. $30.00. You expect it to cost a bit more then else where. But, $30.00 bucks for awful nasty food. Are you kidding me?",1
25753,"I first visited Disneyland about 30 years ago and this trip was just as good as the first one, although the park has been upgraded a made more modern. But the  old standard  rides such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean were as fun this time around as the first. And I much enjoyed the newer rides added since the first visit. I went with my two adult (20s) daughters and it was still enjoyable! And it was still fun to see the costumed characters as we walked about. Mary Poppins will still be a favorite for me! We spent all day at the park, walked back to our hotel to rest and then returned to do a few more things before settling in to watch the fireworks. We saw the fireworks from outside the park the first night we were there, and they were so much better inside the park. Food a bit pricey in some places, so I recommend bringing your own lunch if you can. I would really love to come back some time soon and do the California Adventure.",1
25745,"Love!!! If you've never been then go! You owe it to your inner child! And all the children in you family, your never to old or to young to enjoy it.",1
25747,"Always have a great time here. I recommend coming on a week day, it's less crowded and faster to get on rides",1
25748,"This was my first visit to Disneyland and I loved every minute of it. The entry price is a little steep at $125 for a Park Hopper ticket, meaning you can switch between the two parks, but other than that, it was a great day all round. I was travelling solo so was able to get around both parks on the one day although this took around 9 hours and I was exhausted afterwards. Disneyland is every bit as magical as you see on the TV or movie screen. My nieces have been there twice and I made sure to have a picture of them with me for this trp so that I could have lots of photos taken of 'us' throughout the park with various characters. It was quite crowded but still pretty good for a Sunday. The Fast Pass concept is a good idea and the single rider lines for various rides were great too although this resulted in me being in the front seat of the Splash Mountain ride and I got completely drenched   thank goodness it was such a warm day and I had taken my watch off! I had such a good time, even as a solo traveller, and look forward to going again with my nieces and their mother.",1
25749,"The two parks are very good, and don't seem to get too busy. You don't have to queue too long, if fact on some rides you don't have to queue at all. We went here over three days, one in each park then the third to both to do some of the rides we didn't manage to get on. The new Cars Land was extremely busy with wait times of 2 hrs and over for the new cars ride, we didn't manage to do it as couldn't justify standing in line for 2 hrs. The queue for the fast pass to this was over an hr. The fast pass for this is not in Cars Land it is back over in Bugs Land. California Adventure Park is a mixture of Hollywood Studios and Epcot from Orlando, with something different with the Pier. On the whole, compared to Walt Disney World in Orlando it isn't a patch on it, but if you have not been there would definitely recommend it.",1
25750,"Definitely better to go midweek. My girls loved the Peter Pan ride the most, and so did i. The older rides are getting a bit clunky but still fun",1
25751,"If you go to California you must go to Disneyland, it has atmosphere and history and you can feel the love Walt Disney put into it, unlike Orlando which is just a theme park. One trip to Disneyland is better than ten trips to Disney World, nothing compares to Disneyland, nothing!",1
25754,"This trip was the busiest I have ever seen Disneyland, especially in late September, but we didn't push too hard and got most of what we wanted to do done.",1
25742,"They could do a much better job of putting age appropriate rides together, My kids were very disapointed that they had a half hour walk to get to another ride that remotely interested them almost every time. They enjoyed the california adventure park more for this reason. ",1
25755,"I don't think I will ever get tired of DIsneyland, it is so fun no matter what age you are! Pirates of the Caribbean is still the best ride, and Thunder Mountain Railroad!",1
25756,"I love Disneyland so much and I had a blast! I would go anytime any day! I would say Disneyland is fun for all ages. Babies to grandparents! You are never to young or old for some magic. My favorite ride is Splash Mountain. You do get wet but it has a whole inside part. Plus I also really like Space Mountain. It is a fast roller coaster and it actually seems like you are in outer space! It's so cool! Disneyland also has big parades and shows! One really great show is fantasia. It is a bit load but the show is wonderful! I would also recommend Thunder Mountain! Though, for the Matterhorn i would recommend to go on it if you have NO injuries. It's really fun but jerky. Plus, if you want a good scare, the yeti gets me! And, if you want a sit back and relax in air condition ride, I would go strait to It's a Small World.",1
25757,"We first visited Disneyland on our honeymoon over 40 years ago and loved it.We also revisited it with our kids and theirs as well. This time we decided to go back on our own but could not find enough to do since we passed on the rides (except for Pirates of the Caribbean which my husband said was not like it used to be  I don't recall). What we did enjoy was the short outdoor program performed by Billy and the Hillbillies and the Asimo robot presentation in Tomorrowland. The senior discount was $2 per ticket which could be more. Also, we arrived when the gates opened but it took nearly 15 minutes going through lines to inspect bags Lots of people were enjoying themselves at the park  still fun for newcomers and families. We left by 4:30 p.m.",1
25758,"What can I say? It's Disneyland! You really feel like you are in another world. There are so many small touches that are made here to make it seem like a perfect retreat from the everyday and everyone can just feel like themselves. Lines are long, there are a lot of people, but you have to expect that here. Our biggest problem was some of the older rides (like Snow White and Mr. Toads) are pretty scary for little ones so it would be great if that was notated on their map. I realize every kid is different but how can you complain. It's Disney!",1
25759,"I can't say anything that hasn't been said. It's a classic. It's fun for all ages. Etcetcetc.The updated menu choices were great, the prices for both food and gifts were all (very surprisingly...) reasonable, and the staff was terribly good at what they do.Love it or hate it, Disneyland is THE benchmark for a tightly run and enjoyable opperation.",1
25760,"I'll admit, I was not completely enthused about Disneyland, but its very hard not to get wrapped up in the fun and excitement. As a pregnant lady I couldn't do all the rides but the whole experience was totally worthwhile! Fantastic selection of food, consistently excellent staff and service and things for people of all ages to entertain! Unforgettable.Disneyland is not a place of high fashion, so my recommendation, particularly in the warmer months is to wear sneakers, shorts, t shirt, hat and sunglasses   think comfort. And drink plenty of water!",1
25743,That is what my 8 year old daughter said on Disney   s Main Street at midnight on News Years.  No better place to take kids.  It is a different world especially during the holidays.,1
25741,"Our first day in Disneyland was fantastic   clean, great service ( including extraordinary concern and action with respect to our daughter's allergies from Brittany at the World of Color picnics), no wait more than 20 minutes on a Tuesday in October, clean and plentiful rest rooms and plentiful water bubblers. Despite website advice that you cannot carry food, it was obvious that many people did, which could save quite a bit of money.Highly recommended.",1
25725,"Enriched with history, mystery, thrills, and family fun, Disneyland is the epitome of an American good time. Every child grows up with Disney and Disneyland is the best place to be a kid at any age.",1
25732,"We are from Aus , and got the 14 day pass. What great value it is (Expedia.com.au).The attention to detail in this place is amazing. The rides are good, though perhaps not enough of them to thrill you. But the fast pass system works very well and saves a lot of time in lines . It's also free, so use it to your advantage. This forum has great tips on how to use it.Fantasmic and the fireworks are fantastic and worth waiting for. The cast members are all happy and cheerful, and the place is spotless.Favorite rides would have been star tours (54 different versions though we saw just the 3) , splash mountain , space mountain, matterhorn bobsleds and autopia. Shame that Indiana jones was closed though.Recommend doing Halloween on a Tuesday night as the lines are shorter.",1
25726,"DIsneyland is magical! It still is very efficiently run and the staff, for the most part, are A . There are a couple of staff there who I feel Walt would not approve of though! Talking to each other behind the desk and not promptly responding to me and really who was not a very friendly person in the large Disney store when you enter the park. For the most part, the staff are very conscientious and courteous. The bathrooms were, for the most part again, well kept. However, it just takes one person who does not do their job properly to let that go. Again, one bathroom was not well kept. Because of the high standards at Disney, you really notice when someone or something is not done to those standards. For such a large and busy operation this place deserves 5 stars for being run so top notch!",1
25727,"Had a great time at Disneyland with my daughter. It wasn't too crowded and as always, the cast members we encountered were always helpful and pleasant.",1
25728,Only downside was the Indiana jones ride was closed. Crowds were busy so make use of the fast pass system so you don't spend too much time on the rides. Do do everything you need a minimum of a day and Disney California is next door. Rides aimed at a junior level so plenty to do for kids.,1
25729,"This trip is never dull, always exciting and since we do this annually, I think you can take my word for it!",1
25730,"No matter how old you are everyone loves Disneyland. Found the rides fantastic and the street parades, shops, restaurants all wonderful. Obviously the 'waiting' times were not desirable but was expected. Such a wonderful family fun experience that everyone needs to have.",1
25731,"We enjoyed four days at the resort. Some days were busier than others with no apparent reason. The park is clean, well maintained, and entertaining. Use fast passes for the more popular rides. Food and other items are not priced family friendly in my opinion. Disney counts on you not being willing to leave the park to fulfill these needs. It is still a great vacation destination.",1
25733,"We came to celebrate an anniversary and boy did they help us celebrate! If you can, come during the weekday and not on a weekend. It's much better that way. Also, try and get all your rides out of the way in the mornings, saving the afternoon for a return trip back to the hotel for a rest nap and then return again in the evening for the shows and parades. Overall I had a great time as usual!",1
25740,"Disneyland did not disappoint. We went for our 30th anniversary (went here on our honeymoon). We thought we were going off season, but it turns out that the Friday we were there was the day the Space Shuttle flew over (Disneyland was identified as a good place to see it) and also the last Friday that the Southern California residents could use their passes, so it was just as croweded as a summer day. Thursday was not too bad. On Saturday (which we expected to be the busiest of the 3 days), we were able to to more before noon than on Thursday and Friday combined. Lesson   check what is going on before planning your trip.",1
25734,"No matter how many times you visit anything Disney, it makes life better.  This trip my brother was in a wheelchair and aside from some of the guests not being courteous and paying attention, we got the royal treatment and had the best time.",1

25736,"I absolutely love Disneyland.Went once when I was 12 with my family and then again with my best friend for my 21st birthday.We had a blast and it was my friends first trip there. Lots and lots of walking! We also were only there for 3 days so we wanted to get the most out of it so we were there from early morning when they opened till they closed at night. Note: You will be tired if you do that! :)Definitely get the Hopper Pass (If they still call it that) which lets you go from the Disneyland Park to the California Adventure Land Park as many times during the day as you want.Wouldn't recommend people go with small children as we saw lots of parents carrying sleeping children in the middle of the day, can't be that much fun :( Also you want to be able to enjoy all the rides so make sure your kids are tall enough for all the rides :)",1
25737,Late Sept the lines were minimal. If you can go Mon Wed the park is so much quieter!  Get the fast pass for the new cars ride when the gates open. My husband waited for 35 min and we got one for 530 pm.,1
25738,"Every time we end our vacation from here, we say we are going somewhere else next time, but within a month we always have a desire to return to DL. Our kids are 11, 15 and 19 and they all love this place. We go the end of August and there are barely any lines. We love space mountain and the bid thunder railroad.",1
25739,First time going... but hopefully not the last! Tons to see and do! Worth the money for sure. Tip: Get the southern California City pass,1
25682,"Loved it. Unlike most did not arrive as soon as gates opened by arrived about 11.30pm and stayed to finishing time   plenty of time to see. Went on the Wed & Thurs. no real queus, very unexpected",1
25681,"third time to the park and spent most of the time in calafornia land, which now has the new cars, which was fantastic, had a great clam chowder at the food area",1
25680,Who doesn  t like Disneyland.  The happiest place on earth.  Highly recomended.  Best to go during the week when crouds are not big.,1
25629,Be aware of what else is going on in Anaheim during your stay.  We went to the park during Gay Pride Week and whould choose not to go there the same time next year.,1
25623,"Great time had by all eleven of us. Kept everyone entertained from the Pirates of the Caribbean Ride, to the Jedi training academy. We always enjoy the great restaurants and this year was no different. Just got home and we are already talking about the next trip.",1
25624,"It is Disneyland . . the happiest place on earth. Some of the rides were down, but that happens.  Lots of good times with friends.",1
25625,"My kids will be talking about this for years! We had a blast even with the heat and crowds. People complain about the prices, but it is very similar to a ball game. You can bring in your own stuff so take advantage if on a budget. My daughter loved meeting all the princesses and my 4 year old loved all of the rides. When we left we were already planning our next trip.",1
25626,"Walking down Main Street never gets old.  Disneyland truly is the  Happiest Place on Earth.    Will always enjoy Pirates of the C, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain, It's A Small World.",1
25627,"i went there with my boyfriend, october was great to visit the best tme since lines are so short. i loved it",1
25628,"We had went to California for a couple of reasons, 28 year Anniversary, and our oldest grand child who is 4. The park has took on a few changes and we enjoyed ourselves while we participated in Mickey's not so Scary Halloween Party. While we waited in the long lines for the rides we had took pictures of some of the water features and even in one of the rides Pinnocchio Adventure. The water had floating water bottles, Autotopia cards in the bush by Pixie Hallow, potato chip bags floating in the water where Huckfinn Island is. Pinnocchio had a cellophane wrapper that someone had waded up and dropped on top of the building as you go in. When you stand in line for long periods of time you notice those things.",1
25630,"Disneyland is fantastic, so well established and a joy to walk around. Be aware that the wait times they put up are not accurate   we waited almost double the times stated. We went on a Tuesday in September, which we were told by staff at Disneyland on the day was one of the best times of the year to attend. It was still extremely busy, but bearable. Disneyland do not handle heat very well (unlike Universal Studios who do a fantastic job keeping people cool) so dont forget lots of drinks and hats. Prices in the shops are expensive so if you want to buy Disney stuff and are heading to Las Vegas after your Disney visit   go to the Disney outlet store in Vegas   much cheaper. Although, be aware, the only thing the outlet stores dont stock are the hard mickey mouse ears   so get those at Disneyland if you want them. ",1
25621,"This place has some MAD SKILLS ... they perfectly execute parades, shows, bag check, check in, food, cleaning, announcements, ride operations, security .... everything is tight. No matter where you turn, there's no trash ANYWHERE on the street, no dirty tables, no crabby attitudes, no troubles. The staff is always friendly and smiling whether they are busing your table, selling you a balloon or strapping you into a ride. Very impressive!",1
25631,The World Disneyland is great but Disneyland is greater...The time is not a problem when visiting Disneyland and if you have an extra day then the California Theme Park next door has all the exciting ride to enjoy...The original(Disneyland)definitely surpasses the sequel(DisneyWorld etc...),1
25632,"Even if you have done Disney World, this is worth seeing, as this park offers some different versions of the attraction.  Check out Space Mt, Haunted Mansion & Pirates (way better than FL).",1
25633,"We attended the Halloween party for the second time. The party starts at 6, but ticket holders can come in 3 hours early. Kids love the trick or treat trails. The best part is hardly having a wait time at the rides. Walked on almost everything. The Halloween fireworks were beautiful, but viewing for the fireworks seemed limited. Facing the castle try to go on the right side. We were on the left and the talking head was behind the castle. We went back for a second full day, but it seemed like overkill. Yes we would have missed some things, but it would have given us more to see next time. Love that the park is always so clean without garbage spilling out of the cans. ",1
25634,"loved everything made for the holiday of a lifetime, even got to see the Space Shuttle fly over. We saved hard for the trip amd things are pricey but it was so worth it.",1
25635,"Disliked the huge lines to get on the rides, but it is to be expected when your at the funnest place on earth, also did the disneyland halloween night, awesome fun.",1
25636,You just have to have patients.  Try to plan you activities using the maps and guides.  Fireworks are great and so was the staff,1
25622,"We went on Thursday afternoon and Friday in October and the park was relatively quiet. The Thursday afternoon we probably queued on average 15 20 minutes per ride, if that. On the Friday we queued 5 10 minutes on everything except the biggest rides which were roughly 30 minutes. We ate at the Carnation Cafe on Friday morning we made reservations for 8am for breakfast although it wasnt needed as it wasnt anywhere near full, however as we left around 9ish it was a lot busier. We had the Mickey waffles which is a must they were delicous! For dinner we went to the Stage Door cafe which does mainly chicken, corndogs and chips, the sitting is outdoor with plenty of shaded seating, the food was good and cheap. For tea we went to the Blue Bayou which is inside the Pirates of the Carribean ride, whilst it was very atmospheric and well themed, the food was a bit too 'fancy' for Disney and there wasnt much choice, would suggest reading the menu first, we did enjoy the food though. The best tip is probably just to make the best use of the fast pass, Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain and Star Tours are probably the busiest and have fast passes available. The rides overall were good but tame. Nemo however wasnt great, the Tiki room can be missed if in a hurry, as well as the dark character rides in fantasy land. We were very disappointed that Indiana Jones ride was shut but back open again Winter 2012. We managed to do nearly every ride in one and a half days.",1
25620,"Just got back from a day at Disneyland and was surprised and thrilled to see the Star Tours ride had been significantly improved! Now instead of just one experience there are several. We went on the ride three times and each one was different. If you love Star Tours you will REALLY love it now!! Fun!Was very fun to see the park all decorated for Halloween    especially the Haunted House. They had totally redecorated inside and went with the Nightmare before Christmas theme. Very cool! Even Space Mountain had a Halloween theme. Disneyland is always fun, but this time of year is especially awesome! They also had a special area with live animals and great decorations!Only negative . . . the park was only open from 9   8:00 pm, but we paid the regular going admission that is charged on days when the park is open much longer. Seems like they should charge less if the park isn;t open as long. The best food deal we found was at Rancho Del Zocolo over by Thunder Mountain. They have a Burrito that comes with rice, beans, sour cream and guar that is huge for $10.99. My husband and I actually split it and had plenty to eat! Definitely the best deal at the park!!",1
25638,"I took my five year old daughter on her first trip to Disneyland with our extended family this past weekend. She and her little cousins were in awe the whole time! I'd recommend starting your trip on a Sunday, that way you can get a chance to see the amazing firework show in the evening, but be able to miss the crowds. Fast Passes are definitely the way to go in order to avoid waiting in long lines, as is the Single Rider option (usually less than a five minute wait!) if only a few of you want to go on a particular ride. Getting there early is also always a must! As is bringing or renting a small stroller if you have younger children. And if you want a good view during the parade, be prepared to save your party a spot on the curb early. If you bring a backpack, being able to bring your own food in is also convenient if you want to stick to a budget or have picky eaters, but Disneyland really does have something for everyone, and is even accommodating for those with allergies or a gluten intolerance. Overall, the place is truly magical: for the young and old!",1
25608,Great time. We love going to Disneyland and the area.We will be going back in February and again in April.,1
25601,My boyfriend and I visited California just to see Disneyland. I want to go back again next time and try all the rides I missed. WE should have booked a longer vacation and enjoy Disney more than one day. I have to try California Adventure as well!!,1
25602,"Three adults and two children had dinner at Trattoria with special viewing of the World of Color show. Dinner was absolutely fantastic and we had the Disneyland wine. Pretty good. Dinner options for the two grandchildren (ages 6 and 4) were both tasty (they ate all) and priced right. Viewing area for the World of Color was perfect. Couldn't have been better. Had a great evening!However, next night took in the Fantasmic water show with the dessert package option. That was not good at all. It was too dark to see what we were eating and since half of what was in our trays (that we had to put on our laps while we ate, which means the children didn't fare too well on the balancing act) were desserts we didn't enjoy it especially with the $60 pricetag per adult and $40 per child. The  meal  included some cheese and crackers and a choice of the usual beverage (coffee, tea, etc.). The view was pretty good, but the show seemed anti climatic since the prelude (our dessert package) was not well liked. This evening was disappointing.Nevertheless, as always, the variety and range of rides in the park for every age group was the best ever. Because of these rides, we left still feeling that Disneyland was the  happiest place on earth! ",1
25603,"Disneyland is the original and still the benchmark for theme parks everywhere. I still feel like a six year old kid when I pass through the tunnel under the train tracks. Over the years the imagineers have worked to keep the park fresh and keep Walt's drem alive. It's become fairly pricey and some of the staff needs to work on their gestapo attitudes, but overall a day at Disneyland is one of the best things ever. Thank you Walt. ",1
25604,"I highly recommend the Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween party! Even though the event was sold out (35,000!) we were still able to walk on nearly every ride that was open, and little to no wait on the others plus dressing up and trick or treating in Disneyland! How great is that?!",1
25606,"I have always and will always love going to Disneyland. Yes its expensive but I truly believe you are getting what you pay for. It's a perfect place to get on rides and spend real time with your family. Food is great and if you go during off season, the park closes earlier but its not nearly as busy and going during may through august. Stay near the park it will make your life much easier. ",1
25607,"I was at the California adventure last month and it is my first time visiting this actual disneypark. And wow it was super busy, especially on Saturdays... My advice do all the fast passes available and download the Verizon Disney park app because it is very accurate.. Then line up for the other rides not allowing Fast Passes.. Another tip if you want to watch the fireworks get into the front of the castle by 7:30pm and sit by the street so you have front view of it.. Towards the beginning of the show they will ask you to stand so of your height isn't too tall get there very early..if u want to buy souvenirs downtown disney out the park will have more choices so have fun then spend more.. If you are new to pin trading each holiday you visit a pin varies for the occasion so do buy it.. Overall I will visit this place again because I love disney I general.. One last thing if u want to watch the sensational parade it's worth it.. So get into Main Street before it starts because it gets really busy..",1
25609,"Of course our kids loved it...as parents we're glad to tick this one off our list! Crowds, heat, sore feet and standing in line after line is not really my idea of fun. We thought October was a  quiet  month...I can't imagine what the busy months are like. We didn't have time to do grocery shopping or anything like that so we ended up spending a lot of money on food and drinks. It's nice that you at least have the option of bringing your own food though. The shows were absolutely fantastic and the park really clean   amazing. ",1
25619,"As 2 adults (young at heart!) with a 6 y.o. boy and a 4 y.o. girl, DL DCA are fantastic. We spent 5 days at DL DCA and loved every minute of it, except for the heat wave at the end of sept   early oct but what can you do about the weather...nothing, just keep hydrated and have fun. The first 3 days were great, the last 2 days were OK but there were young tired legs. Our kids definitely slept well at night. At a pinch, DL is probably better for the younger kids than DCA, although our son thought California Screamin' was the best ride ever (x4)!! Anyone considering going, don't waste time contemplating, just go and have fun.",1
25610,"My mother and I went to Disneyland to celebrate my birthday in October 2012 and it was amazing once again! We spent a week there and were able to do and see all we wanted. We thought it would be a slow time, but it was really busy most of the time we were there. Just remember to pace yourself and you might want to have an informal agenda so you can schedule your fun without feeling frantic. Cars land was crazy crowded, but it great walking around   it was like you were in the movie! We went to Mickey's Halloween party and had a ball!",1
25611,"We liked getting a fast pass where available and using the single rider lanes. Check the brochure you get when you enter the park to see which rides have these features.  For some reason, park was extremely crowded for October. Lots and lots of strollers.",1
25613,"Its now my 4th disney park, but my first in US. So its time to see what the  original  parks do look like.There were no promotions available,so adult tix is 87usd...for sure not cheap (considering what you actually get inside the park, i would say its overpriced)! I went there on a week day, avoiding the weekend crowd, but it was still well packed. This park is just opposite the Adventure park, where u will find more fun and thrill rides. The disneyworld is something for young and old. Although it was not as impressing as i thought,perhaps its the lack of excitement,because its already the 4th park (however, its really more a place for the very young...not really the adult fun place, which should be on the adventure side).The food and drink inside the park isnt cheap, so you may take some own supply.",1
25616,"We spent the day at Disneyland, unfortunately didn't get there early enough to do both sides (both parks). There was plenty to do and see for a couple of travellers who were not into roller coaster rides etc. Coming all the way from New Zealand, I just wanted to do the Dumbo ride and the teacups, and did both, and enjoyed them! It was great to see all the familar sites (from TV), advice: take plenty of water and stay well hydrated, pace yourself, you might need more than one day, but get there early and make sure you know which level of the carpark your car is parked on. (if you lose it, like we did, phone park security   phones in carpark, and give them time of your arrival and they can tell you which level they were parking). On arrival, find out when the daily parade is held (sometimes twice a day) and get a good spot to watch this. We were advised by my brother (lives LA) not to wander the streets around Disneyland, stay in the park. Managed okay driving in LA and freeways for the first time (we drive on the left in NZ, so another experience for us kiwis), get GPS (essential, even for locals), plan trips to try avoid peak times on freeway, otherwise you could be there for several hours, and keep your wits about you   especially if driving on RHS for first time, especially turning corners and driving out from gas stations etc.",1
25617,"We are big time Disneyland fans! Our families favorite rides are various from Space Mountain to Pirates of the Carribean, It's a Small World to Splash Mountain. The only thing that would make our days on the property better would be fewer crowds. The park seems to be busier at night, so anytime we go, we make sure to be there at opening and then leave around dinner time. We all had a great time and can't wait to start planning another trip!",1
25618,"We spent 8 days in Coronado the last week of September. Friends from Michigan flew in on Tuesday and had planned a day trip for us to Catalina early Thursday morning. All 4 of us (my son & I and the couple from MI) got to Dana Point early only to find out that the ferry was sold out ... I guess that shows how far in advance they had  planned  this day ... . So rather than scrap the morning I suggested Disneyland. Mixed grumbling ensued but the decision was made to drive the extra 40 minutes for a fun filled day.MUCH had changed   parking, ADMISSION cost !!!!!",1
25637,There truly is nothing like Disneyland. Soo magical and really brings out the kid in everyones hearts! I've been there 3 times all the way from New Zealand and each time is magical and amazing.  I love the Pirate of the Caribbean ride,1
25639,"We loved every day in the park so much to do and see, make sure you see all the shows that are on.   Go to the Park on opening as queues are shorter.  If queue is long on the ride, go single rider.",1
25679,They need more shady areas it is way too hot...For rides that are undercover there is aircon but the wait lines have no cover or very little. we were there in 109 degree heat and had to go back to hotel. Some people were vommiting and fainting I can't believe that happiest place on earth doesn't make it more happy by keeping people cool and out of the damaging sun.,1
25668,"You can do as much research as you like, but Disneyland is crowded no matter the day now that Cars Land is open. I took the kids (12 and 8) out of school for two days and headed to Anaheim for a long weekend. We had a great time, but the crowds at DCA for Cars Land were unbelievable. If you're going, and want to do Cars Land rides, you really need to stay in a Disney hotel to get early admission...even though we did, it was still a long wait at Radiator Springs (great ride). This trip, we spent some time seeing the fireworks (great) and wandering Downtown Disney a bit (decent food). It was unseasonably warm (102   aack!) so we left the parks to swim most afternoons.It's been said time and time again, but it bears repeating...get to the park as early as you can possibly get in! You can visit more rides attractions in the hours before 11:00am than a whole day if you arrive late morning. Use Fastpass. Stay at a Disney hotel if you can swing it to get the early entry. When the parks start getting super crowded (noon ish), bail for a few hours. Go back in the evening when everyone starts leaving around dinnertime.We had a great time. Go with the flow   appreciate the architecture   let your kids explore the attractions that aren't  E ticket  rides (mine loved the Tiki Room, Tarzan's Treehouse, and even exloring Toon Town) when the park is crowded. Take the Riverboat and pet the animals at Thunder Mountain Ranch. Sometimes, Space Mountain can wait for another day...",1
25662,"This was our second time to the park and they have made some great changes. We were disappointed to find that during the renovations and additions to the park that they had not implimented any type of transportation. One of the best parts when you travel with kids in Disneyland is that you have options to rest a bit on the Monorail, train or main street transportation. We found a great bakery in the California Park and it is just inside the Wharf area. There is Mexican, burgers and a great Sour Dough bakery. They made the baked goods fresh everyday. Seating is limited so you will want to go after 1pm for a late lunch to find some shade and a place to sit. The bakery was awesome and we could not finish all of our food. We arrived about 9:40am and tried to beeline to the fast pass for the Cars attraction. When we arrived, we were told by their staff all the fast passes were gone before 9:00 that morning. Just a suggestion, instead of handing all of the fast passes out in the morning, why not keep some and have a time in the afternoon for guests arriving to the park to have a chance to get some. This would be more fair to people not able to be in the park when it first opens.",1
25663,"My hubby and I visited Disneyland Anaheim and California Adventure Park for the first time on Sept 16 17, 2012. We bought the two day parkhopper pass. It was a good decision that we combined a weekend (Sunday) and a weekday (Monday) as we get to see all the shows and attractions available only on weekends for both parks and maximized our day 2 by enjoying the rest of the rides, shows and attractions due to shorter waiting time as compared to weekends. Nevertheless, two days were still not enough to cover everything. If you are the type who loves to take lots of pictures and who continue to be a kid at heart, I suggest you take atleast a 3 day parkhopper pass to enjoy the happiest place on Earth in a more comfortable pace. We will definitely return!",1
25664,"The Characters are walking about taking photos with people , buy an autograph book and they sign it.Best to get there early , get an early pass 1 hr before parks open. The parade is great. Rides are excellent.",1
25665,Loved Disneyland   it was our kids' 2nd trip (age 7 & 9). Perfect age as they both met the height requirement to go on all the rides. Disney staff are so friendly and helpful. Park is so clean and food is good. You only really need 4 days there to do both California Adventure and Disneyland. Bring comfy shoes and hats and snacky food. Great time had by all.,1
25666,"Its not quite as good as California Adventure across the way, but it's still a great day out for kids of all ages, and as we went on a quiet day we could walk straight on most rides as many times as we wanted, we all loved our day here.",1
25667,"I first visited Disneyland when the orange trees were being removed and the castle was being built. That was a long time ago and I have visited the park at least once a year ever since. Though it always changes with new attractions   some good and some removed   good bye flying saucers, what a sad day that was. Since its opening I have gone to Disneyland in Florida and Paris, but it is always fun to return to the first park that sat the standard for all the clones.",1
25669,"Disneyland is one of my favorite places to go, as well as many others in this world...so get ready to wait. If you go expecting that you will do fine. Some days are much busier than others (Sunday is the worst day to go). But the attitude and kindness we get from every Disney employee makes up for it.  Right now it's Halloween time at Disneyland and its amazing. The buildings and streets are all decorated. A few rides have been changed (Haunted Mansion is incredible as the Nightmare before Christmas. And Space Mountain as Galaxy Ghost) I love to see my Son's face every time we go to Disneyland as he sees Disney magic every time we go... And that makes the waiting more worth while for me.",1
25659,"What more do you need to know. Actually, read up on it and know what to expect and not only will your trip be more fun, but you'll likely have more time to stop and appreciate all of the amazing little details that Disney is famous for.",1
25670,"Went there in late August with husband and our 5 year old son. Used fastpass as much as we could. The lines were not too bad but where people queue up desperately need some shades or trees. We spent most of our time in tomorrowland, and went on the rides we like over and over especially if the lines are shorter! I and hubby love Star Tours. My son's favourites are: Space Mountain, Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear, Splash Mountain and Haunted Mansion.",1

25676,"We had an awesome time. We purchased a 3 day pass that included 1 magic morning, so we spent 2 days at Disneyland Park and 1 day at Californian adventure Park. The park staff were great and nothing was to much trouble. Our daughter happily lined up for photos with characters around the park. We saw the parade and fireworks without to much trouble. We went expecting crowds and it was not as bad as we thought it may be. We were happy to wait after all we were at Disneyland !The only downside is the fast pass system. We found the universal studios front of line pass better organized and more user friendly.",1
25678,"We were having the hardest time deciding whether to travel to Disneyland or Walt Disney World. Both are very expensive and we wanted to make the right choice for our family of four (a 3 and a 5 year old). We chose to travel to Disneyland because of its size   more rides in one location and less humid weather. After being there, I can say that I am in love with the charm and heart of this place. Walt made it magic and it shows in every detail. The original is such a perfect place to go with your family. There is an intimacy there that I am so glad we experienced. Our children will cherish the memories of this first Disneyland trip, as will I.",1
25661,"We went to Disneyland for our grand daughter and she had a wonderful time. Everywhere was very crowded which was unexpected, apparently there is a Fall Break from school in California. Every child needs to find their fantasy and this certainly did it for our little one.",1
25658,This is the best place in the world to unwind and release your tired soul. Share it with the rest who dreams the same dreams and aspirations in life. Indeed it a small world after all when you forgot the world outside and enjoy your stay with your loving family and friends including all the tourists of different colors with the same dreams.,1
25640,"loved everything !!!, food, people, rides, etc. I can't say I disliked anything, if I did then I would be very hard to please.  My family and I had the time of our lives.",1
25647,"Family still enjoyed the  old  traditional rides:  Splash Mtn, Space mtn, Thunder mtn,  Pirates of Carib,   but Indiana Jones was closed  BIGGEST disappointment was  revised 3D Star Tours....3D effects NOT very impressive  we spent more time in California Adventure",1
25641,"We came on a Saturday Sunday in mid Oct. and sadly, missed the Halloween party; it was on Friday and Monday. The decor was nice, but I expected a lot more and almost as much as Christmas. We were here mid Oct and the lines were rediculously long, and fast passes gone by mid day. I believe CHOC had their walk in the park on Sunday, hence the crowd. But as always, Disneyland was awesome. Will be back very soon. ",1
25642,Went in mid October and the average wait time for a ride was 20 minutes! The cost of food was not as bad as I thought it would be and bringing your own food beverages into the park was not an issue. Also had great weather this time over year.,1
25643,"You know, I just can   t help it. I have to be unbiased and truthful, even when it pertains to Mickey Mouse. Disneyland is NOT the happiest place in the world.It is the happiest place in the universe!With so many fantastic recent updates and changes, there is still that special something that can not be described    a feeling that can not be duplicated    when walking below the plaque that reads    Here you leave today and enter the world of yesterday, tomorrow, and fantasy   . And it   s true, isn   t it? Try to walk around Disneyland and think about your bills, or the report that is due on Monday. I bet you a churro that you can   t do it!A day at a Disney theme park is one of the few things about today   s society that I can honestly and truthfully say that I believe is worth the money. In this economy, quite a few families may be thinking about visiting less frequently, but in my opinion, cut back on take out. For after all, can one really put a price tag on magic?Disneyland, as always, is unparalleled, whether it be 90 degrees or 65, or whether the wait times are 10 minutes or 60. But people, remember to make use of the FASTPASS! As with a lot of other theme parks, this is not a paid perk, but a powerful tool that every attendee with a ticket may make use of. Simply find the FASTPASS kiosk for participating rides, slip in your ticket, and out will pop another ticket with a time to return to the attraction. (See! I told you there was magic!)If you have never visited the Disneyland park, shame on you! You have been missing what I refer to fondly as    the mountains       my personal Land favorites. Take a whimsical journey through the briar patch before plummeting down a prickly waterfall on Splash Mountain, feel as if you are flying through the stars on Space Mountain, or speed down ice covered terrain, pursued by the abominable snowman on the Matterhorn Bobsleds.Of course, there are the favorites that we all know and love    that seem timeless    transporting us back to memories from our childhood, or assisting to make new ones with our own little loved ones. Seriously    what would the world be without Pirates of the Caribbean, It   s A Small World, the Haunted Mansion, the Jungle Cruise, or Peter Pan   s Flight? It sure wouldn   t want to be a world that I would want to live in!I especially love some of the older, smaller attractions that are not present at Walt Disney World. I will squeal like a six year old on the Casey Jr. Circus Train, the Storybook Land Canal Boats, Mr. Toad   s Wild Ride, or Pinnochio   s Daring Journey. And for you Alice fans, don   t just expect to spin about on the Mad Tea Party, but follow her down the rabbit hole on the Alice in Wonderland ride!And no one has the ability to update attractions, without losing the original components that cause it to be so beloved. Star Tours is an excellent example. What was once a regular (as    regular    as anything Disney could possibly be) motion simulator, has gone 3 D! And the infamous 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, is now sailing through different waters in the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage.Please    please do not leave the park without making a round on the Disneyland Railroad. Much more than just a way to get from one area to another, this is truly an attraction in itself. Plus, Walt would have wanted you to. Say no to that!A lot of folks still refer to Disneyland as one theme park, but Disney   s California Adventure becomes even more a force to be reckoned with! While housing such fan favorites as Soarin    Over California, the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, and It   s Tough To Be A Bug, the themed areas range from a land seen from the eyes of a bug to the perfectly created Paradise Pier, complete with a coaster and Disney   s zany idea of a ferris wheel.But what everyone is talking about is Cars Land. This is Radiator Springs straight out of Pixar   s Cars. There are new shops, new restaurants and yes, new attractions! Yay!The Radiator Springs Racers is just about one of the FUNNEST rides I have ever experienced. Cars holding six people zip through scenes and characters from the iconic Cars movies, and then the real fun begins. Hold on tight    because your car will soon find itself in a dead heat race with the vehicle next to you. And by the way, my car DID win.Mater   s Junkyard Jamboree is an attraction for the entire family. Whip around with the baby tractors to playful music that makes you remember why you love Mater so much in the first place!Luigi   s Flying Tires is just    for lack of a more profound description, fantastic! Seated in your giant tire, prepare to fly across a surface that may best be described as an enormous hockey table. Great job, Imagineers!And if you want to party, head to the Mad T Party! Let me prepare you, this is no cartoon concept. Hello, Mr. Burton, and pour me a cup of tea! This appeals to all audiences, but has an    edge    that shows Disney is more than prepared to do the unusual and the unexpected, and with applause rendering results! Expect zany d  cor and flashing lights, a rock band, and not your three year old   s Alice. Dance to the music, surrounded by toddlers, teenagers, couples, and hoverounds. Only Disney could make this level of diversity work! Better yet, leave your expectations asleep under the tree with Dinah, and take the tumble with the White Rabbit. After all, you don   t want to be late, do you?The close proximity of both Disney parks in California make it possibly to zap from one park to the next, so I would definitely suggest buying those park hopper passes. While it is feasible to visit both parks in one day, picking and choosing which attractions you would like to ride, I do not think that one can experience, well    the    experience    without feeling rushed and anxious to move quickly from one bit of happiness to the next. Don   t sell your visit short. Try to spend a full day at each park, and a third would be nice to    hop    from one to the other, revisiting your favorite places and catching the ones you may have missed on your first visit.In a perfect scenario, stay a week, catch all of the great shows, and don   t forget to spend some time (and money) at Downtown Disney, the premier shopping spot from everything to Disney souvenirs to makeup. (Yes, girls, there IS a Sephora!)Also keep in mind that while each park hosts a plethora of delectable dining options, remember that the Disneyland hotels, Disneyland Hotel, the Grand Californian, and Paradise Pier Hotel, all offer several restaurant choices a bit away from the hustle and bustle.My absolute favorite is the Storyteller   s Caf   in Disney   s Grand Californian, just connected to Disney   s California Adventure. Yummy!But if looking for a good option within California Adventure, check out the new Flo   s V8 Cafe in Cars Land for an amazing breakfast, served on real dishes at fast food prices! The lunch and dinner offerings range from sandwiches to steaks, and are equally as impressive.In Disneyland Park, check out Red Rockett   s Pizza Port. This is not your regular theme park cardboard pizza. This place has awesome pizza, salads, AND pasta! The Count Down Chicken Fusilli is out of this world    pun intended.As I leave Disneyland Resort, my stomach is full of goodness, my hands full of shopping bags, my feet are sore but still ready to explore, and I have stars in my eyes.People often speculate if Walt Disney had any idea that a few sketches on a drawing board would result in a place so full of imagination, wonder, and happiness.I think that he did.",1
25644,who doesn't love disneyland? there were quite a few rides shut down when we were there and it was hot as blazes but it still ended up being an awesome day. we always start at CA now and head to disneyland for the remainder of the day. ,1
25645,"The magick is alive and well at the happiest place on Earth! So fun for a date, or a family trip. We have annual passes and I always recommend that if you are within driving distance of Disneyland. It's the most cost effective way to visit. Go and have fun!",1
25646,"We have been to many of the theme parks in Southern California but as far as the level of the cast members, cleanliness of the parks and amenities Disney has the best of the best!",1
25648,"Just the food is not very good and very expensive. They have very high quality standards and the rides are awsome, no one who visits California should miss it.",1
25657,"As adults, we weren't expecting to love Disneyland as much as we did. We took along our two year old and nearly forgot about her   had so much fun. Go early, not in school holidays, take food, and don't just settle for the fast rides   the kiddie rides were lots of laughs!",1
25649,"Been to Disneyland quite a few times over the years and it's always magic, no other park like it. We far prefer this park to the copies, no other Disneyland parks have the Magic that the original has.The crowds can be bad, but it appears since California Park has fully opened, the crowds are a little lower, but we now totally avoid Disneyland on any Fri Sat or Sunday plus school holidays as the crowds are crazy and it's just not fun. No ride is worth standing in line for for more then 30 minutes in our opinion, and the queues can go over an hour on busy days. Mid week we got on almost any ride in under 20 minutes and a couple which do get busy, we simply do those 1st thing in the morning before the crowds build up.You do need 2   3 days to do it all and the parade and fireworks are fantastic. As fireworks are not on every night year round, we go back at night on the week end just to see the fireworks alone. The park is spotlessly clean, plenty of friendly staff around to ask it you have a question. We find it best to plan the day and work thru the lands in a anticlock wise (or clockwise) direction, as you tend to waste a lot of time zig zagging around other wise.Days are long and sometime hot, but it's still all disney magic.",1
25650,I went a few times as a child and my husband had never been. We don't have children but we still have a ton of fun.,1
25651,never waited more than 30 minutes anywhere.  It is amazing how they make it all about making you happy.  It really is the happiest place on earth.,1
25652,Disneyland is for ALL ages! I have enjoyed it from a child to an adult now... It really is the happiest place on earth :) Make sure you leave yourself around 2 days to make your way around the parks... Take your time and take it all in. The most magical place on earth :),1
25653,"Went down for Halloween and went to the Mickey trick or treat event. Despite being an extra charge, it was great because there are limited numbers of tickets per night. This means low crowds, I hit every major ride with less than a 10 minute wait, most I just walked on. There is also free candy stations everywhere. I went on a Tuesday night so your mileage may vary. The other days were business as usual, massive crowds and hour waits, though its still better than summer. Don't miss the redecorated haunted mansion, and be sure to ask one of the line staff to see the  Pet Cemetary.  You get to see a secret area of the mansion and then they let us skip to the front!",1
25655,"Disneyland, no matter what your age, size is the best, the rides are all fabulous, the attention to detail is not beaten anywhere, the staff are all happy and friendly, nothing is too much trouble to make your day a wonderful experience. The price is $125ish to enter and you think, boy a bit pricey, however it is worth every cent plus some. You must visit it is a wonderful time that you will never forget. Wear comfy shoes.",1
26084,Was all set to hate every minute and there you go   totally absorbed by it. The kids floated around like they were in a dream   a new adventure at every turn. I'd go back. And to he California one where there are so many travel options round it.,1
26086,"Disneyland is not quite Walt Disney World, but it still has a ton of magic around. If you like Disney and are scared to try out Walt Disney World then Disneyland is perfect for you. Because Disneyland is much smaller and compact it is earier to manage and you still get the Disney experience. Disneyland has a ton of great rides and a few surprises. The park is quite compact which makes it easy to navigate but can also make it very crowded. On the weekends in the summer it can be very hard get from ride to ride and the lines are very long. Finding a spot for Fantasmic, Fireworks and Parade can be a challenge, but during the week or while school is in session is a different story. During the busy times, early entry is a must, you can ride 4 5 attrations before the park opens to the general public and even then you have a few more hours until the park gets busy around 10am. We would normally take a break in the afternoon just to break up the day, but the evenings in the park can get really crowded. You need to find a good location for Fantasmic at least 45 minutes before the show. You can see the fireworks from almost anywhere in the park. During the fireworks parts of the park closes (like Toontown and Fantasyland). Use the FAST PASS tickets as much as possible, once you get a ticket it will be good for the return time on the ticket till the park closes. I have been known to have 3 or 4 different attrations of FAST PASS tickets in my pocket. So if the line shows 60 minutes and you can get a FAST PASS for 3 hours later, get the pass and go find a different ride which does not give out FAST PASS tickets. The secret is to never stand in line longer than 30 40 minutes. Sometimes that is hard to do on rides like the Matterhorn or the Nemo Sub ride, but you need to do those rides early or late in the day. Fantasmic is worth the wait, the parade is OK and the fireworks are awesome. Favorite ride   Space Mountain. Most Fun   Buzz Lightyear. Best Show   Fantasmic. Best Food   Hot Cinnamon Rolls (by Haunted Mansion or Big Thunder Mountain) or Pineapple Ice Cream (by Tiki Birds).",1
26730,"I go every year (sometimes more than once) and never get tired of it! There is so much to see and do that a few days are never enough. Even if you feel like you need to rush to make it through all the lines, make sure to slow down once in a while to catch the numerous street performers and musicians that are hidden throughout the park.",1
26494,"Seems that Disney is getting more expensive as time goes on. However, with that said, it's still worth a visit. Disneyland has all the basics that I remember growing up while visiting Disney World. Haunted Mansion, the presidents hall, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, etc. It's still as much as I remember it as a kid.Getting there early is a good idea. However, not required. I guess a lot of it depends when you go. But a lot of the big name rides allow for FastPass. Make sure to keep your park ticket with you. It'll be required to get FastPasses for rides. You'll put your ticket in and it'll spit out a FastPass for you. Make sure to pay attention to the sign near ride entrance of what current FastPass times are. (Really wish they'd also list the time BY the machines as you get your ticket, because sometimes it's easy to think you'll be getting one time but get another because you were remembering for another ride.) Seems you can get one FastPass per ticket every couple of hours. So use them wisely. Get it for the big name rides like Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, and the like.Make sure to get a lot of the Fantasyland things done early in day. They close EXTREMELY early to get ready for the festivities in the evening. Personally I think they close far too early, but that's just me. (Last river boat ride was like 5:30pm or something.) It even says that the area will close early but doesn't state HOW early. So was disappointing to miss the boat ride. They close off the rides to prepare for the evening, but seem to do so much earlier than need to.Also, found another great time to enjoy short lines is during the festivities in the evening. They have a fireworks show. But, if you're not interested or willing to forgo the fireworks display, it's a great time to get on rides. The closer to show time the better the lines are. We'd been putting off Splash Mountain because it was a pretty long line. During the fireworks show we got in with no line at all. Next log that pulled up we were able to get in. Also were able to enjoy the Indiana Jones ride, with a short line this time, maybe 20 minutes max, this way. Earlier in day it had been up to 45 minutes. If you're okay with missing the fireworks, parades and stuff, you'll find there are some good times to take advantage of little to no lines.Pricey to get there from Los Angeles, but not horribly bad. Still made for a great day trip. If you're trying to get to Disneyland from Los Angeles, best way we found was to go to Union Station. From there catch an Amtrak train down to Anaheim. It's about a 40 minute ride, but free wifi while on train. The train is only $14 one way for an adult, which isn't bad. Was the cheapest option we could find to get down to Anaheim, and saved a lot of time versus bus hopping. You can reserve your Amtrak tickets online if you want as well, which is what we did. Go to Union Station and you can bring your tickets out by scanning the bar code they sent in the email (doesn't seem to allow it to scan if done so via an iPad) or the credit card you used to purchase the tickets. Print the tickets and you're good to go. Be aware the stops at each station is short, so be prepared when your station is called.Amtrak station in Anaheim drops you off right by Angel's stadium. Inside the building is a call taxi phone should there not be any there at the time. Taxi ride from there to Downtown Disney was about 16 or 17 dollars. Once you're in Downtown Disney you're pretty much there. Bit of a walk through and Disneyland will be on left side and California Adventures on the right.If you're not sure how to get here from where you are in the area, ask your front desk. That's how we found out about the Amtrak down to Anaheim which saved us all kinds of money from having to get a shuttle or taxi.",1
26514,was a great day! The weather was great too. we wish that we had bought park hopper tickets. Calafornia adventure opened later and had the really cool rides.,1
26515,"With a 5 day park hopper pass, we were able to go on every ride and have every experience we wanted. We used the Disney App to check out waiting times and along with the Fast Pass system we rarely waited more than 15 minutes in any queue. Love this place.",1
26516,"I must admit I am a Disney fan, everytime at the park I am amazed how clean and safe I feel. Getting in the park early is the key for rides. If you enjoy the rides be there when the gates open. Hit the main rides you really want to ride.By noon, it is a different park. School is out and the kids are being bussed in for the end of school parties so,it is very busy. The fire work show is awsome and should mot be missed.Note: ticket prices just went up!",1
26517,We traveled as 4 adults doing Disneyland for the first time. We had a great time overall. Unfortunately the Matterhorn and Splash Mountain were closed but we hit most of the major spots. The lines were relatively short being that kids were still in school and the weather was great. The only downer is that they were not selling Cars 'mouse ear' hats until the following weekend when Carsland opens so I could not get one for my nephew. Hopefully I can order one online soon.,1
26518,"We spent 4 wonderful days in Disneyland between June 2 and 8, 2012. We have been there many times before and this was one of the best trips. On the weekend it was a bit crowed but with the fast track system we were able to see and ride everything we wanted to. During the week it was much less crowded. Our grand son (8 year old) had the time of his life and went on everything as many times as we could. One of the very good rides was the  star tours  ride. There are many different scenes so no two rides are the same. Our grand son was was picked to participate in the Jedi training and was then able to have a duel with Darth Vader. All the rides are great and pirate island is a must visit with children. The fireworks display each night at 9:30pm are fantastic as well as the parades. Every employee there goes out of their way to make you feel like family and not a visitor.If you have not been to Disneyland in several years or have never been there I urge you to make it down as soon as you can.We will be gong back soon.",1
26519,"It was the pefect day to go to Disneyland. It was a overcast day, so the park was not crowed at all! We got through so many rides so quickly and even went on a few back to back.",1
26520,"I spent three wonderful days at Disneyland and had a total blast. No, I'm not a kid, in fact, well lets just say I'm  over the hill . Loved Tower of Terror and Space Mountain and of course the pirates are always fun. Can't find one thing I didnt love from the food in New Orleans to the parade during the day all the way to the fireworks and Evening show. Your never to old to enjoy Mickey!",1
26521,"This is our second trip to Disneyland   the first to California.  Get there early before the crowds to cover some of the more popular rides without the long wait.  The parade and Fantasmic! were very popular, so find a place to view early.",1
26522,"I Looove Disneyland!  My friends and I have annual passes, and go frequently.  Love the special passholder events!",1
26523,I love how great the staff are and how they go out of their way to make sure Disneyland is majical for every one.,1
26525,"We took the grandkids and their parents to Disneyland  had a great time, but it was very crowded! We'd thought we would beat the summer crowds, but found out that it was the last days of the Disneyland pass year, and everyone was getting in their final visit before summer! Overall, 3 days was just right for our visit  fast pass works great, but crowd control is poor. Wish they had signs that said  Keep right   people just walk wherever they want and there's a lot of confusion. A great place to visit!",1
26526,Service and attention to detail is brilliant. Fastpass is a must if you are there at the weekend.  No complaints about anything in the park. Would go back tomorrow.,1
26527,we spent 8 days in disneyland and loved every minute!!!!!,1
26528,"Everyone loves Micky and Minnie. Disneyland is an iconic must see. If you love acting like a kid and catching a thrill, this is for you. Yes of course the tourist come in droves. I love going on a overcast, chill in the air kind of day. Crowds are light and your mood is a lot brighter after a good elephant ride.",1
26529,"You cannot visit Southern California without a trip to Disneyland. Rides, shows, good food, all in a setting that will run your digital camera out of space. Plan to go early and head to the most popular rides first. Even at that speed, you will not be able to get to all them main rides so be sure to use the 'fast pass' feature. Mickey Mouse pancakes for breakfast, eat with the Pirates for lunch, and dinner by Space Mountain. One day is not enough to see it all.",1
26513,It is Disneyland. What more is there to say? If you want to avoid the crowds try to go when the kids are still in school and in the mid of the week. We went May 30 June 2 and didn't know that the grad students would be there so it was still a crowd even though most kids were still in school.,1
26512,"Spent last week at Disney. Was first time for our kids and it was the best trip we have had in some time. The park was more crowded than we thought it would be but once we learned the fast pass system and to come early stay late it did not seem as crowded. We left each day mid day for lunch and a swim at the hotel. Fast pass system works great, be sure to do the early arrival days for the park and Toontown. My 6 year old daughter got lots of princess meetings and was also able to see Mickey and Minnie plus several others. Service was very good the whole trip. California Adventure was just as good but the rides are more extreme so our older boy liked it better. On ride we all liked was Toy Story Mania. The evening shows were the best must see but get your spots early as seating is limited. Also be sure to be in front of the castle for the fire works and get the fast pass for the World of Color show.Just remeber to plan you day and try to take a break once in a while. If you can eat off park you will save $$$ and get better food however the stands where they sold fruit and drinks were good and fair priced. We will be returning soon but will try to make it during off season.",1
26511,Nothing this place was the most well organised and cleanest places i have been too.,1
26502,"We had another great time at Disney. The only complaint it that my mother has a disability, and she was unable to use a disability pass on all the rides at California Adventure.",1
26496,"I first came here when I was 8 and have been many times since, and now I'm in my mid 30's. I still love it here. When I walk down Main St, the sweet smell of caramel, the adorable shops, disney characters, transports me into another world. I will continue to take my kids here in the future. ",1
26497,"We are big Disney people and go to both California and Florida as we live in Texas. When you go to Florida, most people are tourists. We noticed this time in June 2012 at Disney that most of the people were locals, there for the day, that treat the park like it's the local carnival. When we walk down Main Street we get a feeling of awe and excitement but this time the park was crowded with grads for some grad night and tons of locals who have annual passes. I thought they are blacked out during the high tourist seasons. So for those of us who come once every few years, we were faced with longer than usual lines and lots of screaming babies, toddlers and people who for them it was just another day at the local carnival. Disney needs to offer more incentives to people who stay at their hotels, use the WDW travel company and Disney Visa like we did. Maybe give us fast passes, special character meet and greets at our hotels that are not a character meal, more discounts as we are spending alot more money than the people that live there and when you don't receive a great experience you are not in a hurry to come back.That being said...this was the third time we have been to Disneyland in 10 years and every time the Matterhorn is closed. The rides were all enjoyable and lots of fun. We spent two days at Disneyland and one day at DCA and was able to ride everything we wanted to except Splash because of long lines, no more fast passes and it broke down once. We met a few characters but the lines for the princesses were 1 hour 30 min. The food at the park, we ate at Pizza Port by Space Mountain was terrible and expensive. Disney needs better food options. $3 for a bottle of water is so ridiculous. If there's one item you should charge less for it's the water bottles. Love the Mickey Ice Cream bars and Mickey pretzels. Should you go to Disneyland or World? Many of the rides at DL are better than the ones at WDW such as Thunder Mt., Pirates, Small World, etc. They are the original rides and are longer and more fun. The park is much smaller in California though so maybe there are less people but they are congested in smaller spaces. Overall, if you are a Disney or ride fan, this is a great park but look carefully at the calendar of events and annual pass holder dates to see if this park will be crowded or not.    ",1
26498,What a great day to spend with grandkids.  Always magical.,1
26499,"Fun family vacation spot.  Very busy, but Fast Pass is a great idea!",1
26500,"Disneyland is one of a kind. Sure there is Disneyworld and so many other theme parks but none are like the original. If you go in the summer, you HAVE TO BE PATIENT, The lines will be long an its possible you will only get to go on 4 5 rides. Go in the off season months and there often is not a line. There are plenty of good restaurants such as Mimi's right out side of the park whose prices are much better and quality of food better. Disney tends to sell only over priced junk food. None the less, Disney gets a 5 star rating. You have to try it at least once.",1
26501,"My nephew and I have annual passes. We return every other month to HPOE (Happiest Place on Earth). He just loves going on the same rides over and over again. Each time, though, I travel through Pirates, or the Haunted Mansion I see something I haven't noticed before. ",1
26503,"We have been going to Disneyland on a regular basis since 1998 on personal trips and taking tour groups of 20 30 kids. You cant do DL & CA in one day (not even 5) if you plan to see all the shows attractions and parades. There are a few things you must do however if you want to make it a little more magical.........hope they make it a better stay for you !!1. Have Breakfast in the park: forget the other character dining experiences like goofys kitchen, story tellers and ariels grotto, they are all over priced, foods not worth the $$ and the character experiences are not that great.....The BEST by far is Breakfast with Minnie & Friends in the park. Make sure you book with Disney dining....although if you drop by the plaza towards the end of breakfast time, you can often get seated at a cheaper rate. Character experience is great   more characters that you can poke a stick at and they interact well with all the kids and adults. Buffet Food is good for the price.2. Magic Morning: if you have a park hopper (3 day or more) then you should make sure you spend the magic morning in fantasy land   before all the rides fill up with little kids...hit peter pan first. Get there at least 1.5hrs before regular opening time.3. Halloween Nights(if you are there then): these are well worth the extra money....basically they throw everyone out of the park that does not have a Halloween ticket and then you have the park with about a 10th of the people normally in it. Free trick or treating, and more candy than you can possibly eat....remember to say Please and Thankyou ...the cast members will throw in more candy at the stations....HOWEVER this is also a good time to go on rides (as they are almost empty) if you are not into the candy stuff...PARTY...well there are several dance parties...make sure you spend some time talking to the cast members... they will often look after you with some tips....4. Shows and Parades: how many times have i heard someone say        i didn   t really like DL     ??? then i find out that they didn   t go to any shows, didn   t look into the shops & parlours, didn   t talk to people, just wandered around and looked at the rides. You MUST make the time to see the shows and parades. There are quite a few, Fantasmic, the street parades (in DL & CA) fireworks at the castle and just after fantasmic     stay seated ! also ones like the light show in pixie hollow(there are 5 of them at different times) also in frontierland show at big thunder ranch and the saloon etc....not to mention CA shows like Word of Color, Alladin and the dance parties, (mad hatters, etc) pixar parade, check your guide each day.5. Mickeys Toontown Morning Madness: you get this as part of a vacation package room ticket deal with DL resort. However you can also get it through AAA and Costco travel. While the show is a bit ordinary     mainly for little kids (for the Disney dedicated it is still a must do) it is however a fantastic meet and greet for characters     especially Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Pluto & Daisy. 6. Pre Christmas in the Park(if you are there then): it is worth it just to go see the lights. But the other little touches around the park are really magical. Kids can meet Santa and Mrs Clause in the workshop and reindeer...which is a great little experience.7.Go on Everything: people with pre conceptions about DL usually don   t enjoy it as much. Its OK to act like a child in DL....no one else will notice or care     there are plenty of us there doing the same thing !! The rides are all fun and interesting in their own way....ONE tip     go on outdoor rides at daytime AND night time     it adds a real new experience to things.8. Photo Pass Service: Take lots of Photos...Use the Photopass service     you get the great family shots, and the photos are unlimited number. Just ask any DL photographer for a photopass and you can collect the shots later on CD or download them for a fixed fee.(which is cheaper than paying for them...you can even get the shots from rides put on the pass if you ask..Also there are plenty of photo ops in the park. Getting into the spirit of your photo will make them that much better and they will be some of the best souvenirs you will have once it is all over.9. Take Time: Look into every door: we were amazed at how many little things go un noticed by the regular visitor. My tips is stick your head in to every door window you can...Disney puts little surprises everywhere and you can see a lot of things others don   t. 10. Stay Until Closing: it is a magical thing to just sit in front of the railway station     looking down main street and watch the park closing.....we have been the last to leave the park many times and it is quite a unique experience to walk out of Disneyland...the last to leave.",1
26510,As fun and crowded as ever....there's no place like it!,1
26504,Great park but food is expensive.  Fast pass for popular rides is a must. Make sure you see parade and fireworks.,1
26505,"My family and I had a GREAT time here... MUCH better than California Adventure. Only one ride was closed down (the matterhorn) so we got to do a LOT. Wait times weren't bad at all, staff was super helpful, it was a blast. I was in a motorized wheelchair dealie due to an injury, and that didn't hinder us at all. They are very good at accommodating anyone and everyone! :)",1
26506,Love Love Love this place. First time to Disneyland and it lived up to all my expectations. We had a 4 day pass and could probably say another day or even 2 would have topped it off. But in those 4 days we got to do almost all the rides in Disney and about half at California Adventure. Do not go on a weekend. So glad we did 3 days on a weekday. So much less crowded. The Saturday was PACKED and had to wait a VERY long time in lines. Got to see all the characters. They are constantly around and on occasions someone new would pop up. The rides are all fun for all ages. Break downs of any rides were fixed very quickly. Food choices are the usual theme park food. Burgers and fries. But no complaints. Disneyland soooo much better than California Adventure. Do not need more than a day at CA. Would recommend anyone staying in Los Angeles or Anaheim to do Disneyland and also to stay either at the disney resorts or hotels across the road. Best thing was to be able to walk home after a long day at the park instead of waiting for a shuttle bus home. Would do it all again in a heartbeat.,1
26507,Sharing my wonderfull experience.... This attration is one of the best of Disneyland Paris. when you go in the roller you feel a espectacular sensation. when   ou are prepared to launch you feel a big force impulse you to the  sky . very very very good. Then you are going in the building you are going to the unknown space. you only can see planets ear sounds and cannot see anything. after a few minutes the roller arrives to the end and you fell that would repeat the experience.,1
26508,"An icon in Anaheim and a great way to spend the day(s). If you love Disney, this is the place to be. Plan on everything being expensive and crowded but worth it anyway.",1
26509,"My kids LOVED every single minute of it! It also helped that we spent a lot of time researching where the best places to eat are, or best places to watch World of Color and Fantasmic were. People were very friendly and it truly seemed like the happiest place on earth. It was too bad we missed the Cars Land opening. My boys would have absolutely loved it. We saw it from the Ferris Wheel at Calif Adventure and it looked so interesting and true to the Cars movies!Don't miss Jedi Training Academy. This was a highlight of our trip and the kids loved watching their videos when they were chosen to be Jedi students.IT'S A MUST DO!",1
26530,"insane crowds that day.  Glad that we didn't have the kids with us.  I love disneyland and we will be going back, hopefully when it isn't as crowded",1
26531,Being in a resort hotel you are offered all amenities from the three hotels.,1
26532,Next time will look out for public holiday weekend and avoid the crowds.,1
26559,Just loved it. We visited in late May so not too busy. Our childhood memories of growing up watching  Disneyland  on black and white TV in country australia come to life. We were big kids just for a day. Only hope I get the chance to take my grand daughter there one day she would love it.,1
26553,We really enjoyed our trip to Disneyland.  Prices on food are escalating alarmingly.  We intend on bringing PB and J next time! However the magic was there!,1
26554,"I went down and had a great time. I saw people eating turkey legs randomly and that gave me a chuckle. The rides were pretty awesome too! If you're in the Anaheim area or travelling to Southern California, make sure you stop at this one of a kind gem.",1
26555,Great Family Place! This was my entire family's first time except mine and it was a blast. The food and beverages are kind of pricey but that was to be expected we planned a head took with us what we could and saved a little extra for this expense. ,1
26556,The place always better even if we get older. They are always adding new attractions every year.,1
26557,"What a wonderful experience to take in all the music, rides, parades, shows, eateries, shops, grounds and gardens, fireworks, Fantasmic & World of Color in California Adventure. A magical day or two or more!",1
26558,Need not to go in the nice weather. The fast pass really slows up the line. For customer waiting. My girls WAITED for splash mountain for  1 hour and 30 mins. At night.,1
26560,"We visited Disneyland in Anaheim by Los Angeles and had a great day out. The park is really beautiful, I wouldn't call it large but it offers attractions for everyone.Of course there are some attractions that are for small children only like Mickey Toontown but you can certainly find something to do. We also loved the plants, flowers and decorations all over the park. Really beautiful.",1
26551,"We went to Disneyland on Memorial Day, which I'm sure was terrible timing for the crowds, but was the only day that we could go as we were on a business trip.That being said, the lines were not as bad as I thought they would be, and we took full advantage of working the Fast Pass system as well as the Single Rider service. As adults I think that a full day is enough to do both parks if you are not really interested in going on every ride and if you are prepared to put the full day into it   get there early and leave late.Something else I thought I'd mention   despite there being so many people in the park I never had to wait to go to the bathroom, and these were kept clean and tidy.If you had kids then you would definitely need a lot more time as there is so much for them to do, and see.Fireworks were a stunning finish!",1
26561,"great park, Doesn't seen as big as the Florida ones, which was a bonus! All the expected Disney razzamatazz...Brilliant, we all had a fantastic time (mixed family group). tip get a stroller for the little one, ample stroller parking around the park. Lots to do for all ages.",1
26562,"Yes, it's not Disney World, but it's still well done, keeping up with the times and feeling magical to young and old  though young will especially like the rides. The legendary service and attention to detail is still a part of the personnel and setting, more contemporary rides and shows are part of the ticket, the parade is still stunning (and loaded with talent), and in all, it's a great day's show. Arrive 45 minutes early to be in line  they let you in for Main Street before the rest of the park opens  and get where you want to be before the crowds build. Still fun  and thanks for noting if this review helped you.",1
26564,"There is no better place than the original Disneyland to spend your vacation! There is so much packed in to this area it will take at least five days to see everything you want to see at this resort.Use your imagination and you can go almost anywhere you want. Under the sea, into space, back in time, into the future, its all there. It is magical! It is worth the money!",1
26565,"Took a quick jaunt to Southern California on business and stopped in with a friend to experience Disneyland. So nice to simply relax and tour the park, taking in the atmosphere. We rode a few of the rides, but mostly strolled and relived a few old memories, sitting at the various benches and other spots available. A much needed diversion.",1
26566,"My husband, my 4 year old son, my 2 year old daughter and I visited Disneyland for the first time last weekend. We really had a blast. I am glad that we waited until the kids were a little older to come by because they had so much fun now that they met some of the height requirements for the rides, like Autopia. We did an insane 12 hour day at Disneyland and the kids LOVED it. I think they will be talking about it for a long time to come. Very expensive but highly recommended for any family with young kids. :)",1
26567,"The park was clean. We went at the start of summer break. It was crowded but we never had to wait for more than 30 minutes on most of the little kid rides. We lost our camera at the beach, so we took advantage of the Disney photographers. They take great shots which you can view and order online. Character photos always have another cast member forming and keeping the line orderly. This is a big improvement over the kid frenzies of the past. Use the Magic Morning to ride Peter Pan and others with long wait times. The 3 day park Hopper meant we could take our time and not have to rush. The two little ones took naps in hotel both afternoons. They stayed up one night to see the fireworks but it is too much for a 2 3 year old to stay up after 9:30 pm. The first third of The Pirates of the Carribean is a very scary. Proabably more so than the Haunted Mansion for a child under 5. The Jungle Cruise ride and Storybook Land Canal are both more enjoyable after dark. This surprised me as I have been going here for 40 years. The live music is exceptional at Disneyland. We made a reservation and ate lunch at Blue Bayou. $26 for a Monte Cristo Sandwich. Diner is $30 47 an entre. Not worth the price, but the food is good and you are paying for the atmosphere. We had little ones, so I couldn   t ride space mtn, Indiana Jones, etc. My favorite kiddie ride was Astro Blasters. You battle the evil Zorg with laser blasters and a cart you control. I was so into shooting all the targets, that I barely notice my 3 year old standing up in the seat next to me jumping up and down trying to defend the universe. It is fun if you are a gamer, because you get a score and can enter you name after the ride ends. The Jedi Training Academy show is a lot of fun. Our little ones were too little to follow directions so we watched the show two days in a row during lunch. It is a funny show and the kids get excited to see Dark Vader and the storm troopers. The Princes Fantasy Fair is something we really wanted to see. The wait times were too long the first two days we checked. The third day we got in line 15 minutes before the 9 am opening. We were told that everything in the Fantasy Fair was closed except the pictures with the princesses. Normally there are three princesses, but today there was only Belle and princess Mini. It was a big disappointment for many of the princesses in the crowd. We still waited the 30 minutes to get pictures with Belle. It was worth it as she took time to talk to our 2 and 3 year old. The fireworks show is incredible. If you are taking pictures, the fireworks explode over the left side of the Castle, so position yourself to the right. The Disneyland train is great for getting you quickly around the crowds from the parade and night time shows. It doesn   t matter you age, you will have a great time in Disneyland.",1
26552,Good fun kids enjoyed it and they liked it. Food in Disney land is expensive           ,1
26550,"Just go!  The cleanliness, the FOOD, ... wow!  So glad we have annual passes!  Can't wait to go back!",1
26534,"We live in southern California...but a couple of hours north of Disneyland. Our family of 3 have had annual passes for about 3 years now. We started out using it as Christmas gifts for us & just have continued. It makes it easier throughout the years for days when you  just don't know what to do.  :) The premium pass is the way to go! FREE parking! %'s off merch & food! It's great. Really nice to just take our son & see a show & have dinner. Super nice not worrying about if we didn't get to ride a particular ride THIS time...because we'll be back next week!...or soon enough! :) After a couple of years, we know Disneyland inside & out. PLUS, did I forget to mention w  the premium passes you get to park hop the SAME day?! :) Especially nice since California Adventure has been expanding. :) The Holidays are super fun too. Inexpensive way to go! Halloween trick or treat throughout the park! Christmas snow! Birthday parties are extremely nice to have here as well! Any meal with characters are a certain WIN! Birthday cake decorating with Pat E. Cake is so fun! :) Take advantage of fast passes too! Note to Disneyland: Please stop selling us CHEAP china made toys for SO expensive!! Love the toys...HATE the quality in SOME!",1
26541,"First things about Disneyland. It's historic, it's amazing, they do everything 'just right', everyone is helpful, and many times we found ourselves just amazed at how first class everything is. The attention to detail is amazing. Sure, a person could complain about food prices and line ups, but...hey   it is what it is   you know that Disney is going to be busy, and with so many lovely things that they do right and are so over the top, the trade off is in ticket, meal and bevvie prices. Yes, Disneyland is expensive, but isn't everything these days? Even though it's the original park, they are keeping up with the times and the magical feeling is still there for young and old. My 7 yr old was starting to question the authenticity of many of our cultural 'tales' (santa, magic, characters, etc), and 15 seconds after we walked through the gates and Minnie Mouse was there to give her a hug, she was absolutely thrilled and enjoying the 'magic' of the experience. We can argue the philosophy of the 'truth' in this situation, but I personally want her to enjoy the happiness of these magical experiences while she still believes and accepts it. The parade is fantastic, full with the characters and lots of spectacle   make sure you stay and take it in! There's so much to see and do at Disney   arrive 45 minutes early to be in line, because there will be lots tons of people there, and you can get access to Main Street before the rest of the park opens and then be where you want to be before the crowds build. You need a couple of days to do Disneyland justice. That said, if you were very organized and methodical (but is that the point of a holiday here?!??!), you can cover the park in a day, but you wouldn't be taking it casual in any regards. We hadn't been in over 15 years, and this was the first time for our 7 and 5 year old. It's a big park   take a stroller, the kids appreciated that! You can still take in your own snacks, so we had a good supply of those and didn't have to purchase too many of these in the park. Because it's been a few years, things have changed at Disney with the advent of Fast Passes, etc. I would encourage you to get Fast Passes to every ride you want to go on! It just reduces the length of time you'll be standing in line dramatically, because the line ups get long, and it's warm standing there! Also, I learned by fluke about Single Rider passes, which is where you go on the ride as as single person, and they escort you right to the front of the line and fit you in in the first available single empty seat. Or, Family Switch passes. The whole family went to the front of line with a Fast Pass, then my wife would ask for a Family Switch pass, take the ride while we walked out the exit path. She'd walk up the exit path at the end of the ride, hand the pass to me, and watch the kids while I walked back down the exit path and immediately jump on the ride. If your kids are young, or not tall enough to be on the ride, the Switch Pass is a godsend. Eat early, around 10:30 or 1:00 for lunch and 4:00 for dinner to beat the long lines. Ride the most popular rides, like Indiana Jones, etc, first thing, before the lines get crazy long. The Fireworks are so worth staying for   a stunning conclusion to the day! I would recommend waiting until your kids are at least 4 or 5 to really enjoy Disneyland. It's warm most of the time, the line ups are long, and if you go early for the Magic Morning, you can log in over 12 hours at the park! There are many minimum height restrictions (39 ) for rides, too, so...Disney really is a magical experience, and although I've enjoyed the trips we've made there before, it really took on a whole new enjoyment seeing it through the eyes of your kids. We'll be back!!",1
26535,"Disneyland can be so fun and beautiful, but crowds can really affect your experience. It's stressful, you can't walk without almost tripping over the person in front of you sometimes! Don't go on a weekend, don't go on a holiday, don't go anytime from the last half of May through Labor Day, don't go the second half of December. Don't go during Spring Break, whenever that is.",1
26536,Who doesn't love Disney? A little sad about the price increases!!! We always have a great time here!!,1
26537,Rides are excellent. The parade was beautiful; with all the colors and floats. The only thing that was a bit of a disappointment was not enough characters out on the grounds.,1
26538,"Perhaps it was because we visited on a weekday before Memorial Day, but the crowd didn't seem to be so maddening as often portrayed. In fact, we managed to get exciting rides like Splash Mountain without a queue (we did not take FastPasses for that) 45 minutes into opening hours! Maybe it's good planning after all, to set some more exciting rides at the further end of the place. We had a really fun time there, though the rides were mostly pretty mild. Still, the magic is captured! Totally recommended!",1
26539,We picked teh last week of May for our visit. The mornings were not so bad but by afternoon it was full with long lines. It seemed like all the schools was taking their classes to the park on the last week of school. Will have to do better planning next time.,1
26540,enjoyed every thing the parades the rides just great,1
26542,"Disneyland, it may be small, but it is probably the best Disney park that was built. Number one, the theme park right across the street, California Adventure, and Downtown Disney, also right across the street, is very convenient to get to, unlike Disney World where you have to take a monorail or bus to each park, number two, this is the park that Walt Disney walked in, rode the rides, and dreamed of the future of Disney Parks. This second reason is what makes Disneyland most magical, it was all seen in Walt's eyes. I have been to Disney World about eight times. Truthfully, Disneyland Park, has a lot more to offer than the Magic Kingdom does. Don't get me wrong, the Magic Kingdom is one of my favorite places to be in the world, but Disneyland had a few more things, that bumped it up a bit. Okay, getting to Disneyland is very easy from your hotel, that is, if you are staying in Anaheim. If you are staying at a Anaheim hotel, I would suggest that you get one that is close to the front gate, because in the mornings, we just walked to Disneyland. It was short and easy. They have many hotels around the area. Disneyland itself offers some attractions that Walt Disney World does not. Such as Indiana Jones and the Forbidden Temble, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio's Daring Journey, Mr. Toads Wild Ride, and a Toontown, that has not only Mickey, Minnie, and Donald, but also Goofy, and Chip and Dales houses. The Toontown is much bigger, than the now demolished Toontown in the Magic Kingdom. Along with the familiar attractions, such as Pirates, The Haunted Mansion, Snow White, Peter Pan, and Pooh's Honey Hunt all have different queues, and different show buildings. They also have different lands such as New Orleans Square, and critter country! I am sure that you will love Disneyland. Hope you enjoy your stay!",1
26549,"Very similar to Disney World in Orlando, but not as spread out. A lot of the same big attraction rides such as space mountain. Have fast pass but lines not to terribly long. Splash mountain had a 45 min wait at one time, but the rest were under 20mins most of the time. Lots of places to stay within walking distances and bus to most nearby hotels. Weather wonderful. A little chilly at night, at least this time of year.Great experience. Loved the fireworks, saw them from hotel room Friday and Saturday night.",1
26543,"My daughter and I are Disney history buffs and we love this park.  We were told to be disappointed because it is smaller than Disney World, but forget that, it was great and we loved it.",1
26544,Get Fast Passes to all your fave rides right away. Saves you from standing in long lines.,1
26545,"Use the fast passes to boost your ridership of the attractions. Eat early, around 10:30 or 1:00 for lunch and 4:00 for dinner to beat the long lines. Hit the most popular rides   Indiana Jones etc   first before the lines get longer.",1
26546,Always enjoy the time here.  It is clean and eveyone is helpful.  Can't wait to return.,1
26547,"I've been going to Disneyland since the day it opened in July 1955, so I've seen a lot of changes. The park is still fun to go to, but the extreme crowds are hard to deal with. Maybe Disneyland should have a  fast pass  for entrance to their park??!! There are just too many people there at one time to enjoy the park's ammenities     it's suffocating. Of course the rides are fun, but it takes away a lot of the pleasure when you have to wait an hour and a half or more to get on one ride. I truly believe that Walt Disney would have thought of something to limit the crowds allowed in each day. I'm not sure what, but he was a very creative thinker and not just interested in profits, but in the total experience of his visitors. It just takes the joy out of the visit to have to deal with such huge crowds. Of course, I'll always love Disneyland itself   I just wish I could actually see it     instead of a sea of heads!",1
26548,"OK, its getting a bit tired in places, but there is still a fantastic atmosphere attached to the place. Walking down main street USA as it starts to get dark, with a parade going on around you, artificial snow falling   pure magic.",1
26495,"My 4 year old great grandson loves this place , he still did not get enough after 3 days",1
26493,"I am sure this has been reviewed, but I have to comment on what a wonderful trip we had with our 2.5 year old son this spring. He LOVED everything about Disneyland. We went for two days and were rewarded with an amazing new view of Disneyland through the eyes of our son. He was able to ride many of the rides including Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, everything in Toon Town and all other kids rides. He got to meet Mickey which he thought was awesome. He ran from place to place and had fun with the basics such as climbing all over the firetruck near the entrance, watching the parades and riding the train throughout the park. It is expensive, it is crowded (though better when we went then holidays or summer), it is time consuming and requires patience BUT...it is AMAZING!",1
26569,"Very busy, an hour wait on some rides, but worth the long wait in the end.",1
26491,First week of June is a good time to go to Disneyland Resort. The lines are short when the park first opens. Take advantage of this time to go on rides that will have longer lines as the day goes on. Wait times were short till evening. ,1
26433,"As a frequent visitor to Walt Disney World in Florida, I was excited to visit DisneyLand. Enjoyed walking in Walt's footsteps and comparing DL to the Magic Kingdom. Loved every minute and found DL to be a charming park to visit. Definitely stay for the Fantasmic show in the evening   it's a  must do !",1
26434,"I always rent a scooter when i go to conferences or to amusement parks. The extra money spent is well worth it. A scooter makes the difference between a great time and one that is extremely physically challenging. This time I had a little snag. I was just finishing up at a conference at the Marriot. I had planned within the next half hour to go to Disneyland. Before I left I went to the bathroom. Just as the toliet self flushed, I heard something hit it. It was my scooter key. A Scooter 4U has such great customer service that they were there within an hour with a another key. And they did not charge me. I highly recommend this company for all your scooter needs.",1
26435,"We spent four days here in June as a family of 3. This was a first visit for us all to celebrate our daughter's 6th birthday in July. It was everything we hoped it would be and more; the Cast Members were delightful and always happy to be of assistance. Our daughter loved the attention she received wearing her special birthday button. We loved, loved the fireworks over Sleeping Beauty's castle; it brought tears to my eyes as it was something I had always dreamed about seeing. I had expected it to be super busy being summertime in the US, but was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not! We didn't really have the need to utilise the fast pass system as the longest wait we had on any ride was about 30 40 minutes tops. The wait time never seemed that long because we were caught up looking at all the details provided by Disney in the set up of the rides. We were able to ride all the rides we had wanted (some more than once) in the time we had there! Can not wait to go back again!",1
26436,"It was just before Carsland opened to the public.  The parks were not that crowded.  We always have a wonderful time there and this time was no different.....Always remember to do fastpass, this will save you so much time and frustration waitin g in lines.",1
26437,"If you're familiar with Walt Disney World in Florida, the small size of Disneyland is very apparent, but that works to it's advantage because it's very easy to walk the short distances between attractions! The combination of Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure has most of the attractions of all 4 theme parks at WDW, with the exception of most of Epcot Center. Great place to go ... crowds are large, but there's always something fun to do without waiting in long lines. Leave the kids at home if you can, it's a lot of fun for adults! :)",1
26438,"For our honeymoon, my wife and I bought Southern California Citypasses   Zoo which included 3 day park hopper tickets to the Disneyland Resort as well as 1 day tickets to Universal Studios LA, Sea World, and the San Diego Zoo. It was worth the money. We enjoyed everything, but Disneyland was our favorite. There is way too much to see in Disneyland for me to review all of it, but I will tell you our favorite things. There are 3 night shows that you should not miss. They are Magical, Fantasmic, and World of Color. I would recommend that you see them all on separate nights. They are all magical shows to finish off the night. My favorite was World of Color which is a water and lights show that you just have to see to understand how amazing it is. My wife really liked Fantasmic which has water, lights, fireworks, and appearances by all the Disney characters in costume. And of course Magical is the famous Disney fireworks show.Our favorite rides in the Disneyland park were Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Indiana Jones, Star Tours, Matterhorn Bobsleds, and Pirates of the Caribbean.In California Adventure we liked California Screamin' (My favorite!) and Grizzly River Run.We really liked Disneyland more than California Adventure, but some of the rides we wanted to go on were broken down in both parks which was a bit disappointing. Unlike other theme parks, however, Disney staff is always friendly and helpful, and they are everywhere. There is ALWAYS a Disney worker at the entrance to the queuing line of every ride. Even if the ride is broken. We were very impressed. Line wait times were really not too bad when we went. We usually waited 25 30 min. However we made sure to get Fastpasses for the popular rides (Space Mountain, California Screamin', Grizzly River) which helped a lot.There are now two new sections in California Adventure which we did not get to see when we visted: Cars and Main Street USA. Maybe the addition of these will improve California Adventure.One last tip: There is some good food in the park (We LOVE the turkey legs), but if you don't want to spend a lot of money on food, you can bring food into the park. We saw a few people eating sandwiches they brought in, and we brought some snacks in my backpack.",1
26440,"Disneyland, still an amazing place to visit. My group and I had 2 day hopper, and if you go early, have a big lunch, and stay late, two days is plenty for me at Disneyland. I went on each ride I wanted at least twice, some four times, save for the Car Racers, a new attraction at California Adventure, which even when we were within the 1st 100 in line, the wait time was over an hour, and twice the ride was broken, so we waited in vain. The new park of Carland does look amazing, and fun, but we just couldn't handle the wait time.Food at Rain Forest Cafe was amazing, and better than spending the same money for a hot dog and a soda. Bring your own snacks.If you can handle the rubes and rude people, Disneyland is simply amazing, and after not going for 27 years, it was still great. Pirates is and always will be the best ride!",1
26441,"This is a family favorite, and the reason that we go to Anaheim.  Adults and kids alike in our whole family enjoy going.",1
26442,Something for everyone. A three day pass was good to not exhaust yourself too much.,1
26443,"Been here 16 years ago, still fun. Became a kid for a day.  New 4D attractions   very exciting.",1
26444,"I have been coming here since 1964 so it is one of those childhood memories. Yes, it not as big or flashy as Florida but it is convenient and can be done in a couple of days max during the summer and one day in the off season. As noted by others, avoid coming here in the summer because of the lines unless you have to (we had nephews and nieces that had just gotten out of school). We normally go September or later.If you have to come during the summer, have a plan. For example, get there early. Know that you can get through the gates and queue up in front before the official opening time. If you don't, others will. Have a strategy, We go get a fast pass for a popular ride and then head to another (Star Tours fast pass) followed by Pirates and the Haunted Mansion. Save the stores and less popular rides for later when the kids wake up. Go back to your hotel room after 11 am or so and come back at 5 or 6. During the fireworks parades are a good time to go on the rides if you have already seen them.Good luck and relax. It is still the happiest place on earth.",1
26445,I am an annual pass holder and go to Disneyland a couple times per month.  On the last trip I went to photograph the evening fireworks and had fun doing that.,1
26446,"First thing in the morning is a great experience at Disneyland with a 9 year old. No lines, get fast passes to re ride quickly and the freedom to explore. Afternoons are so crowded that a Disney employee had to stand in the middle of the crowds pointing on side in one direction and the other side in the other direction. ",1
26448,"I grew up going to Disneyland and it will always be a special place to me. I don't think I'll ever grow out of this place. So many things have not changed but I do love the changes such as the Indiana Jones ride   that ride is so much fun!! Also at Christmas, I love how they change the decor in the Haunted Mansion   it makes that ride so much better. Tip: go get a fast pass for Indian Jones as soon as you get into the park   that line tends to be one of the longest. Pirates of the Carribean never takes that long to get into, even if there is a line. It moves pretty fast. It's always a great ride and its really great when you need to get out of the heat for a little while.",1
26450,"What can I say...I'm 55 and have been visiting since 1960. I love it and there is definitely an energy of happiness and joy there. One thing I noticed, their photpass system was a mess. They lost several pictures even though we had our pass, and when they found them, they couldn't print any because the system was down. I wish they'd do something with the old   America Sings  building...it's a cavernous hulk that should be either torn down or put to use!",1
26432,"Best theme park to visit handsdown, they treat their guest good and provide a great family time.",1
26431,"Disneyland   Walt Disney's Original park   is a must see American attraction. Whether you come for a day or longer, Disney can accommodate you so that you may enjoy the best the park has to offer. Tours are available for first time visitors so that you are guaranteed to get on the best attractions without waiting in line all day. Fastpasses help, too, but get them early for the most popular attractions. The Biggies: Space Mountain, Star Tours, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Splash Mountain, The Matterhorn, The Haunted Mansion, and Pirates of the Caribbean. If you have time to enjoy more of the subtleties in the park, I would suggest visiting the Art Gallery in Main Street Plaza to enjoy their rotations of original themed art exhibitions (currently on display are original production art, et al regarding the trains of the Disney parks), enjoying the innovative and ever0changin window displays throughout Main Street and New Orleans Square, finding the names of Disney imagineers, et al on windows throughout Main Street and Adventureland, Taking time out to listen to the live music, like the Royal Street Bachelors at the French Market, petting the goats at the Disneyland Ranch petting zoo (and staying for the 6 pm  Running of the Goats ), and don't forget the fabulous arcade on Main Street with it's marvelous antique penny machines that show vintage scenes of all types! If you live near Disneyland, an annual pass is your best bet to enjoy the park through all the events of the year, whether fast and furious is your style or a nice walk to view the seasonal landscaping. Something for everyone at Disneyland!",1
26430,"Disney gives more than your money's worth in child security, educational programming, quality acting, especially the Jedi Training Academy.  My grandson was in heaven.",1
26419,"It's Disneyland. That is the positives. Only negatives Food was disgusting at this one place with a cobblestone entranceWe got stuck four times on the Haunted Mansion (made me laugh, it's okay)Bumper to bumper traffic on Pirates of the Caribbean that's it. It was a great trip.",1
26413,"Cars Land was packed, and the changes to CA Adventure was nice.  The Magic Kingdom has remained the same   which is good for memories.",1
26414,fun day at disneypark.enjoyed the rides.fastpass great idea save time lines.enjoy,1
26415,The land of magic and awe. Something for all ages     aren't we all kids at heart?,1
26416,We were lucky enought to get here after way over 20 trips to WDW. Much smaller and rides different. So funny to see how tiny this castle is in comparison to Cinderellas :o) We had a ball!,1
26417,"had a great visit, managed to see and ride most every attraction.  Will return again!",1
26418,"this was our 6th trip here. we love it, make sure you ride splash mtn.,pirates of the carribean,haunted house,it's a small world,indiana jones,jungle cruise and we always take the train on a tour around the park!",1
26420,Had so much fun at Disneyland. We found it works great to get there for when the park opens and see as much as possible before early afternoon. We went back to our hotel for a brief nap and recharge and headed back in the evening when the lineups had died down.,1
26429,"By now almost everybody knows Disney is a great, busy, loud, and sometimes frustrating place. That will never change, but it will always be Disneyland.",1
26421,Our grandkids had a wonderful time and it was years since we had been and the park never disappoints !,1
26422,"My siblings and I just came back from our third visit to the Happiest Place on Earth, and our time there couldn't have been more perfect!! Only I have been to WDW before, but whenever we go together to Disney, we always choose Disneyland, as it is nostalgic, and has that special charm that WDW unfortunately in my opinion, doesn't have. Since Disney's California Adventure park was quite busy with the opening of Cars Land, Disneyland park was very quiet, with almost no wait on most of the rides! Even for the Radiator Spring racers in Cars Land, we only waited for 1.5 hours. We avoided Fastpass in the morning and just chose to stand in line instead. The quality of the rides and the atmosphere that Disneyland Resort exudes is truly magical, and makes for a fun and memorable experience. I definitely recommend arriving to the parks early, taking advantage of Fast pass for the longer wait attractions, and making sure you see all the evening shows (World of Color especially!), as well as Billy Hill & the Hillbillies in Frontierland (hysterical!). For World of Color, I highly recommend the picnic lunches, which give you a pass to priority standing area. My siblings and I had a direct center view of the show from the second section up (the front will get you a little wet!), and it was perfect! For those who have never been to the first Disney park, I highly recommend it, and you will not be disappointed!!",1
26423,"We went during the summer because we took our 9 year old grandson. The lines were between 15 to 90 mins. depending on the popularity of the ride. The worst was that the most popular ride, space mountain, broke down on us 3 times in one day and after waiting more that 60 mins, they didn't offer anyone a fast pass for the next visit. Overall, both parks there are lots of fun.",1
26425,"The park is great for all ages. I am traveling with two adults, teenager and a nine year old. We spent two days at the park and could have done a third. The rides and attractions are fun, the parade was great the fireworks and light shows are awesome. This is worth the time and money. Stay at a hotel close to the park and multiday tickets are great. No major negative.",1
26427,"I have been coming here for years and it never gets old. Disneyland has perfectly themed rides. Splash Mountain and Pirates are my favorites. Indiana Jones is awesome. Fantasyland rides are greatly themed and aimed towards all ages. The new matterhorn looks really cool at night and the bobsled design is better too in my opinion. Space Mountain and Astro Blasters are my favorites at Tommorowland. New Orleans, my favorite area is home to Pirates and Haunted Mansion. The food is good and the park is amazingly clean. Main Street has great shopping areas. Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth. I can't wait for more great experiences at Disneyland!",1
26428,"There is greater place to take your little ones! You will need more than one day, so I recommend the multiple day passes or the California City Pass",1
26452,"It has to be said, there really is a different atmosphere in this park. You can almost feel Walt's input, as his dream lives on. While the Castle may not tower to the heights of it's Florida counterpart, the park certainly makes up for it in charm and appeal. With old favourites like the Matterhorn having a much needed refresh, Disneyland is ready to impress and thrill many generations to come.",1
26453,"We had an awesome day at Disneyland! We got there on a Saturday within a half hour of the park opening and spent all day there. The longest we waited for anything was probably a half hour. The Matterhorn wait was about an hour but I didn't ride that. The Star Tours ride is awesome...especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Space Mountain was a blast. My four year old son loved Toontown and rode his first roller coaster over there. The Small World ride is a classic and a must. Too much fun stuff to list everything. There are Fast Passes that are free for some of the rides which can save you alot of time on busy days...and if you are a single rider see if there is a seperate line for that. Surprisingly prices are not that bad inside. They are still high, it is Disney after all, but I've seen worse. The souvenirs are less in the park than some of the same things I bought my son out of the park in San Diego. And guess what? You can take food into the park! We stopped and got McDonalds on the way in and they will let you in with a bag of food, drinks, etc. I was really surprised but you can definitely save yourself a little money that way. And just so you know, no alcohol is served in Disneyland at all. California Adventure does sell beer over there.My son absolutely LOVED the parade. Don't miss it. And my advice is to video tape the whole thing. We weren't in the door 10 minutes from being gone for 11 days and he wanted to watch it immediately. He watched it probably 5 times the first day home. Went to California Adventure too and Downtown Disney but those will be other reviews. Yes Disneyland is smaller than Disney World, which we went to last year, but the California weather beats the Florida weather anyday! No rain and no sweating. ",1
26454,"I grew up going to Disneyland and have visited WDW many times as an adult, so I enjoy taking tours of the Parks for the  insider's  view experience. A Walk In Walt's Footsteps tour is offered twice a day (9:30 & 1:30). The tour costs an additional $60 above the cost of a park entrance ticket, however, if you pay for the tour with a Disney Visa card you receive a discount. Reservations for the tour may be made up to one month prior to your visit  which I would recommend doing if you have more than 1 or 2 people in your group, as the tours are generally limited to 10 12 people. This is a WALKING tour of Disneyland, so wear comfortable shoes because you will be on your feet for most of the 3.5 hours of the tour. Checkin for the tour at the Guided Tour courtyard on the left side of main street square at the main entrance to Disneyland Park (to the left of City Hall). Arrive 10 15 minutes early to give yourself plenty of time to checkin, as each guest is asked to select from the lunch dinner menu for the box meal provided at the end of the tour. Each tour group bypasses all lines (including FastPass) to visit some of the attractions. The day I took the tour, we road the Jungle Cruise, Disneyland Railroad and visited the Enchanted Tiki Room show. The tour also takes visitors in to the entrance vestibule of Club 33, where you are encouraged to have your picture taken in the French style elevator that goes up to Club 33. If you have a spare $25,000 you may become a member of the club with an annual fee of $15,000 thereafte  that is IF a membership opening is available.As with any tour, the guide and fellow tourists can enhance the experience (or not). I have been on many tours at WDW and have always LOVED the tour guides. This was my first tour at Disneyland and I was disappointed in our guide. He was a very nice guy, but I would peg him as an introvert. He had obviously memorized a bunch of facts about the Park, but had not mastered the art of delivery or conversational style. My fellow tourists were all adults who attempted to draw him out and  loosen him up , but I can totally see the whole experience going quickly south if children had been on the tour because he was NOT engaging. However, even with that, I would recommend the tour  especially for adults. The tour highlights details of the park a casual visitor would easily overlook and it is always nice to meet fellow tourists.",1
26483,"A wonderful time was had by all!  Fun rides, Disney characters and of course, it is a wonderful place to be!!",1
26474,"These folks know how to treat their guests. We had three of our group in wheelchairs, but never missed out on anything. Had a great visit. Staff went out of their way to accomodate everybody in the group.",1
26477,disney has been around as long as I have.  What a joy to have such a positive influence on children of all ages.,1
26478,"We love Disneyland.  We happened to visit just as Cars Land was opening.  The parks became very crowded during the First Day festivities and Grad Night celebrations, but it wasn't as bad as I'd feared!  It's always a great day at Disneyland!",1
26479,We took our three year old and six year old and we had the best time! Lines were all short and kids enjoyed everything. I do wish their was more variety in food though. Same menus.. Loved the night shows and the parades! I was a bit concerned how some of the teen girls were dressed. Many inappropriate for a family park. I feel Disney may want to consider a dress code. Also we had to remind some other guest to watch their language also. There r lots of young children around. ,1
26481,If you are going to go to disneyland park go on a mothers day or fathers day the park is not very busy we got on all the rides that we wanted to get on with little or no wait time at all California Adventure was the same way with the exception of the new Attraction Cars Land that just opened June 15th 2012 that was a 2 3 hour wait,1
26482,As always My family and I loved Disneyland. The cast members are always nice and polite and happy. This is the first time going in June and it was very crowded even with the early mornings. Thank goodness for fast passes. It seemed to be very crowded due to graduation nights and the soft opening of Cars Land at California Adventure. My family still had a great time but prefer going in February or October. It also seems people are getting ruder and overheard a couple of families stating they lied about getting a pass saying thier family memebers were handicap so they wouldn't have to wait in line. I wish Disney would ask for some sort of proof as it seemed a lot of these people did not seem handicap at all.,1
26484,"What is left to be said about Disneyland? It simply is one of the best examples out there of an organization that strives to provide an outstanding experience and level of service. Yes, it can be crowded, and the food choices are expensive and leave a bit to be desired. But it really is a  magical  place. I've never left a day at Disney (Anaheim or Orlando) feeling like it was not a fair price for the level of entertainment and service that was provided.I have fond memories of visiting as a kid, and now, as a parent too.",1
26472,All the employees at Disneyland were very friendly and helpful.  Not so much though at California Adventure,1
26485,Visited Disneyland for the first time at age 63.  Have been back three times. You can't get enough of this happy place.  Early May is a great time to visit.  First timers get the three day pass.    One day is not enough.,1
26486,"Always a great time, use the fast passes. Star tours was terrific and food is improving in the park. Happiest place on earth!",1
26487,"My 8 year old son and I both love this park.  This was our first visit in 4 1 2 years, and Disney never disappoints.  This time his favorite was Star Tours, which is great!",1
26488,To think that this is where it all started   that you can walk down the same main street that Walt did   walk past his Apt and never know it  in itself amazing  The amount of entertainment attractions and shows in the small area is beyond belief   If you are used to the size of Disneyworld  Magic Kingdom   or any other spin off you will be let donw inicially by the small scale  The Castle in D L looks like a miniture golf castle more than it does the other Castles in the other parks  dont let the scale fool you though   The Pirates ride here is the BEST   being able to float past the Blue Bayou guests as they dine   seeing the fire flies and THEN plunging twice into the ride is just one special touch that only D L has   the entire Fantasy land is as magical on the outside as the ride are on the inside  and the build out of SMALL WORLD is a gem of early 1960's artwork  I am showing my age but I wish they would leave things alone a bit   like Renaming The Swiss Family Treehouse into Tarzans but   whatever  Go at Xmas to see The Nightmare Before Xmas version of the Haunted Mansion   by far better and more exciting than the original and the ONLY park to have it I AM IN LOVE with the park !Stuart May,1
26489,"During our trip to L.A we decided that we were going to spend FIVE days at Disneyland. What a fantastic idea that was!! Some may say that five days is way to long, but surprisingly we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was amazing. We travelled from Australia with a 10 year old, 12 year old and 17 year old, who were very thankful for then time we had spent at this place. However... I do not recommend visiting this place during peak periods(spring break) we spent numerous hours lining up for rides or to meet a character but it was all worth it In the end.Our favorite rides were space mountain and splash mountain! Highly recommend this fabulous place for all ages!!",1
26490,Everything  though  we  are  grandparents   we  were  just  like  two  kids  again,1
26473,Two new additions to California Adventure Ariel's Under the Sea Adventure was everything my daughter had been waiting to see!  Cars Land too busy to really get a great experience but I'm looking forward to going back!,1
26471,"I have to say with this being our second visit to Disneyland in 3 months!! I found this trip to be better! We visited the park 5 days this time and City Hall gave us an 'arrow' pass to help with our sons autism. It doesn't guarantee right on the ride, but generally put us in the fast pass and some rides the exit. The cast members are pretty friendly and always willing to help! I can't wait to come back!!",1
26455,"Have not been to this park for a few years and was a little disappointed   there were very few characters around the park for the children to see, although they could see them in the parade has got expensive if you can only visit for a day we got hands stamped and used the restaurants across the road for lunch and returned to the park Too many VIP queues so had some long waits has changed a lot since my first visit 25 years ago ",1
26462,"Our kids had a blast at disney and didn't want to leave even when they were exhausted. I was impressed with all the scenery but the wait times for rides was lengthy at times. Certain rides also seem to always break. Space mountain, indiana jones and Roger rabbit. ",1
26456,"Exactly what I expected and more. Was told it wasnt the 'busy time', would hate to be there when it was as thought it was quite crowded. Found it safe as was warned it may not be, staff courteous and helpful. Toilets and other facilities clean. Lots to see and do only two attraction rides not working   recommend if going for one day to get map and info to plan where to go when for what as would be easy to miss parts of park if short of time   if you have the time to spend 2 days at the park you will see everything   recommend  fastpass  option as waiting time without it would be awful   up to 1 2hrs for some rides   15mins with a fastpass   essential if you want to see the park over one day only, and if you have older children who wish to ride multiple times  Fireworks at 9.30pm have a story and are well worth standing and watching. Fantasia show by river at 10.30pm was brilliant French cafe served good food. Very surprised by queue of thousands at 11.30pm wishing to camp outside park for official opening of CARS ride due to open at California Park adjacent to Disneyland at 8.00am next morning. Bus services great and honest   left my full wallet on bus in error and it was returned untouched ",1
26457,"We stayed in Holiday Inn Buena Park which is about 10 15 min ride away from DisneyLand if the traffic is clear.The first time we did was to take the train that goes around Disneyland to have an overview of it and we ended up with our first ride at the submarine. It was a nice slow ride in the submarine where it goes around in an artificial pool.Unlike Universal Studios, Disneyland does not have a system of queueing for taking pictures with some of the mascots except for Mickey and Minnie, and winne the pooh with his friends. People were crowding around and makes photo taking difficult. The queue to to a photo with Mickey in his house was very long about an hour. However it is worth it as you will walk through his house which is so nice and sweet. The queue for Minnie is shorter.Most of the time we went around taking pictures and shopping for merchandise. This place will be perfect for families with children. I'm sure they will love it. Most of the rides are suited to children but many of the queues were much longer.There is a boutique there that will provide make over for your daughter and change her into a princess and she can be in that outfit throughout Disneyland. I thought it was cute and sweet. But I guess it wouldnt be cheap.It is similar to Japan's DisneyLand. However, you will not find nice cute tins of Biscuit in Anaheim like those from Japan and HK. I guess they don't really focus on merchandise. I do find the service excellent. I suppose the serive attitude in LA is always very good. We felt welcomed and enjoyed the trip.We ended our quest for rides at the canoe and decided to find a good spot for the parade. The parade will commence from the entrance of the Disneyland and move up to the central area (castle). You will see Mascots and decorated vehicles. So find yourself along the roadside and you can be comfortably seated on the road to watch the parade. I think it starts aroun 6 p.m. or 6.30 p.m. We had some time left to get some food for dinner and find ourselves a spot for the fireworks. We were seated along the roadside just in front of the castle. We got ourselves a gianatic turkey leg that cost $10 USD and we dont like the taste at all. The hot chocolate and chocolate chip bread was nice. It kept us warm in the evening. The temperature was below 16 degrees celcius.The fireworks was worth waiting. It lasted about 20 mins with tinkerbell and dumbo in the air.",1
26458,We visited on our Anniversary date of June 13 through the 20th. The park was very crowded after about 1pm in the afternoon. So suggest one goes as early as they can to get the most in before it gets to crowded to enjoy yourself.,1
26459,"rides, theming are great...good times for all, spent 24 hours straight in park and had a wonderful time, lines were average in day and very long at night",1
26460,"Not sure I can anything new for a visit to Disneyland, but here is my review anyway. I've been visiting Disneyland for many decades and have always enjoyed myself and especially enjoy coming with friends and family that never have visited before. While it has grown over the years, become more crowded in the off season and is more expensive it still provides a ton of experiences!First, there is a lot of grumbling about the cost of Disneyland. Not sure why others think that Disney should be any different than a place like a ball stadium or a Broadway show. In the grand scheme of things, I personally believe that there is a good value to the cost of things. Last year I was in NYC and went to the very top of the Empire State Building, that ticket cost over $40. Now compare that to a one day ticket to Disneyland and you might see there is some value to what you get. Not saying it isn't expensive, but compare it to other events and it seems reasonable.The food has improved greatly at Disneyland. Some of my favs are the Hungry Bear with great seating along the river. Cafe Orleans with delish gumbo. And nothing beats enjoying some chili while watching Billy Hill and the Hillbillies. The exclusive Fantasmic dessert viewing is a fine treat, but is spendy and truly a special occasion event.Haven't been to visit since the recent addition of Carslad, so looking forward to seeing some new things. Most of all just take your time and sit down and just enjoy the views, the sounds and comfortable weather. It isn't all about standing in line and rushing to get on every ride. Some of the best and missed features in Disneyland are the little things like the voices and sound coming from the windows on Main Street.One other thing, I prefer stay off property at the HoJo Anaheim. In many cases it is closer than the Disney hotels and cost less.",1
26461,Great time with lots of shops and great food. Had a blast.,1
26463,Magnificent place. Fast passes are great and can avoid long delays. Trick is get to the park when doors open and get to the popular ones first,1
26470,"First of all I was super stoked to get our tickets half off online and NOT be scammed. Cannot stress that enough...On our trip down from central cali was me, my husband, my 8 year old step daughter, my 4 year old daughter, and my 2 year old son....and we ALL had a blast!! The one down side was that we only went for one day, and there is no flippin way you can see even half the park in one day. My favorite thing was that even my son was able to get on everything that we did...even Pirates of the Carribbean, which even i let out a little scream on. We've decided to make it a yearly trip, but next time stay at least 2 days :)",1
26464,"Not a big Disney fan, but fun to see grandchildren enjoy the experience.",1
26465,"With the rates for passes shooting up, this will be our last year for Premium or Deluxe passes. $649 dollars is a lot of $$. We love it, but we are smart enough to know that now is going past our reach financially. But the Disney brand is the best there is, that's for sure.",1
26466,I'm 27 and I felt like a kid again.  I loved it more than words can describe!,1
26467,Everyone was so friendly and nice and the park is cleaned to perfection as usual!  Love Disney! Thank  you for a memorable vacation!,1
26468,too crowded    but still fun. missed opportunity to see disney at night,1
26469,"Love the place hate the crowds. Nothing compares to Disneyland and Clifornia adventure , everyone young and old should visit at least once in their life.",1
26568,"Disneyland, it was the 2nd time for my husband but the first for our kids and myself and we were not dissapointed.We attended the Halloween Party and were filled up with candy so much that it filled a carry on suitcase we used on the way home we also gave some to our room service guy but they just kept filling it up even as we were leaving. I would love to do this again.The food was yummy and very creative, and one we figured out how to use the fastpass system we had it sorted. I even took the two kids by myself one night.Our daughter also had the Bippity Boppity Boutique experience where she got dressed up and made up like a princess she loved this very much she loved it so much she wanted her hair done the same another day so we ended up letting her have it done again.The rides we found were very friendly for children ages 6 & 9 we had a 7 day pass so did not use it to go all day we would wander in and out on different days. We just loved being able to do this.Planning our next holiday to Disneyland.",1
26571,It's Disney magic as usual! Expect crowds and embrace the fact that everyone is there trying to have as much fun as you and you'll enjoy it a lot more!,1
26087,We had a 5 day hopper pass and we enjoyed the experience ! You are never too old for Disneyland ! Staying close by meant that we could come and go as much as we liked. We loved all the rides and attractions that Disneyland had to offer.,1
26654,I do enjoy going to Disneyland but the constantly raising their prices is annoying me; they know people will still pay for it the problem that we pay more and we get less.....They should think about the families with kids that are having a hard time with the economy and isntead of get reacher help them have a disent time..... after all this is a place for kids.... I don't have any.. I am just saying...,1
26675,"Disneyland line up is not as crazy as it may feel like, even on a busy day. Just be prepared to wake up early and get to the front of the line and use Fastpass system wisely. Also, buy Ridemax and plan your rides before you go!",1
26676,"No one does it better than Disney! Outstanding attention to detail, Disneyland offers a fun filled time for all ages. This is my third trip here with my children and we enjoyed ourselves as much as the first time. The park was definitely busy on the weekend, but we found mid week to be much quieter. We would get there for opening and ride as many of the popular rides as we could. Once the crowds started to descend on the park, we would use the fastpass system, which is excellent for bypassing all the long line ups. May is a good time to go as the weather is usually very nice and the crowds are not too bad. ",1
26677,"We went to Disneyland, Sea World, San Diego Zoo and Universal Studios. The lines were great!! Actually not much wait time at all, maybe 20 40 minutes at the most!! We got through each park within 1.5 days and rode rides more then one time. The weather was nice, and traffic not so bad( except going from Anaheim to Hollywood) recommend staying in Hollywood if going to Universal Studios. Universal Studios new ride transformers is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOT TO GO!! Never had I been through such an awesome experience of a ride :)))))) Its in you face   total experience of a ride :)))",1
26678,"We love Disneyland! We go every year and we'd go more often if we did not live so far away! We love the rides, the atmosphere, the hotels, (not the prices) the shows and the sunshine as we go during winter for a break from   20C and snow. Our favorite rides shows are Toy story, Space Mountain, Muppet Theater, California Screamin', Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lightyear, and so many more. Usually after 3 days of hard slogging will get you through most rides and shows. We get there when it opens and usually leave when it is closing, so it is a long day. The prices are high but you get a lot for your money. The food in Downtown Disney is quite good with lots of variety. We have not taken in all the shows there as my daughter is still preteen. Would recommend it to anyone with kids.",1
26679,"Though smaller than it's monstrous brother in Florida, Disneyland has everything you need. Our 4 1 2 yr old was able to handle the parks with no problem. You may walk by attractions and not even notice them because they are so close together. Castle underwhelming, but blew away my little girl. Characters more easily accessible. Food expensive but healthier quality options are there if you look. ",1
26680,"Love Disneyland. I try to make it down at least once a year. Even if I'm not in the mood to ride the rides, people watching and enjoying the shows is worth it right there.",1
26681,Disneyland makes you smile!  Makes you feel happy and forget your problems!  Music plays through the air and uplifts your spirits!  LOVE Disneyland!,1
26682,"First time visit with our grand children, was as good as we had hoped.  Looking forward to our next  Disney Family Vacation: !!",1
26683,"Suspend disbelief, give yourself over to the nostalgia and piped music and let yourself go and just enjoy. There's a reason it's called the Magic Kingdom, because it's as close to magic as many of us get to experience in the hum drum of daily life. Get in early, hit the mega rides first, then spend the afternoon wandering around soaking up the strangely surreal atmosphere of people being happy (and the odd kid bawling their eyes out, here and there). The biggest surprise? It's sensational value. If you don't get sucked into buying a Jedi Micky or a Indiana Donald (true!) you can get away with a reasonably priced day out. Hmm... except you really need two days. A day and a half for Disneyland, and a quick half day walk around the ghost town that is Disney's California Adventure. ",1
26685,Happiest place on earth. Took the kids for their first visit. We were able to ride all the rides we wanted to go on. It was busier than we had expected. We chose to go on a Tuesday thinking that it would be a ghost town. But our longest wait was only 40 minutes. Nothing to complain too much about.,1
26686,First time taking the kids and I don't know why we waited so long.  It is a place of magic for all ages.  We will be back soon.,1
26687,"This was my second trip to Disneyland. The last (and first) time I went, I was 9 years now. It's been almost 20 years. Lol. Amazing trip overall. I don't think it's possible to have a bad day at Disneyland. Since everyone knows what Disneyland is like, I thought I'd make my review about tips on how to get the most of your day there: 1. Buy your tickets ahead of time. We arrived Thursday afternoon in Anaheim. That night, we drove and parked at Downtown Disney (free parking for the first three hours), then walked through Downtown Disney to the Disneyland gates (which are open most nights until 10:30pm) to purchase our tickets. Believe it or not, there was a line at 9:30pm at night to purchase tickets. Purchasing the tickets the night before saved us a good half an hour waiting in line the next morning.  2. Arrive EARLY. Check what time the park opens for the day you want to go and get there 10 minutes before the gates open. They actually start letting people in a few minutes before the official time. 3. When you first arrive, don't waste time waiting to have your picture taken in front of the Disney logo made of flowers. You can do this later in the day when everyone else has taken their picture and it's less busy. 4. Before you go, visit the Disneyland website and go over what each ride is. Get a general sense of which rides you want to do and which ones you don't. When you arrive, walk straight to the back of the park and work your way back. You'll be going against the flow of traffic and beat most of the crowds.  5. Learn to use the FASTPASS system. We grabbed a FASTPASS for the new Star Tours ride first thing in the morning (it's the newest ride and quite popular and I recommend checking it out) and while we were waiting for our FASTPASS time, we went and did the rides close by to kill time. When we were there last week in early May, the park was fairly dead for the first few hours of the morning. We were able to do several rides in the morning easily with less than 5 minutes wait for most of them. 6. Parking is $15 a day and you can avoid those costs by booking a hotel that's close enough to walk. This way, you can also go back to your hotel in the afternoon to have a nap. We left around 1pm to go have lunch at a nearby restaurant. There are lot of restaurants along Harbor Blvd (where our hotel was) and it is much more affordable to eat there than inside Disneyland. I spent over $6 in the morning just to have a tiny OJ and a small cup of tea.  I recommend Mimi's Cafe along Harbor Blvd and if you sign up for their eClub online, they send you coupons for buy one, get one free breakfasts, lunches and dinners. We saved a lot of money by eating there. My boyfriend loved their banana chocolate chip pancakes. 7. On our way out around 1pm, that's when we stopped at the Disney logo made of flowers to take our picture. It was much less busy then and we were able to get a picture without anyone else in the background. When came back around 4pm (after lunch and a nap), the park was PACKED. There were way more people and strollers everywhere (plus crying and screaming kids).  8. Bring a jacket for nighttime because it gets cold.  9. We choose to watch the 6:30pm parade. Around 5:30pm, we purchased our dinner at Disneyland at one of the food carts (the jumbo turkey leg and buttered corn is the BEST, and the line for the pineapple whip ice cream is worth it) and then found a bench along the parade route and enjoyed our dinner. This way, we were able to nab a good spot before the parade started. The only problem with this was that by the time the 6:30pm parade rolled around, the sun was starting to set and our pictures had a lot of shadows. In the summer months, I'm sure this won't be a problem though. 10. We were there on a Friday and the fireworks were scheduled to start at 9:30pm. Around 8:30pm, we were pretty much done most of the rides and shopping at Disneyland so we decided to go out to Downtown Disney and walk around and come back in for the fireworks. BIG MISTAKE. We came back around 9pm to go back into the park and the lines to get back in were atrocious. We ended up sitting in the middle area where Disneyland Park and California Adventure Park and Downtown Disney intersect to watch the fireworks. A lot of other people do this also. However, you cannot see the full extent of the fireworks because they don't go up that high and if the Monorail passes through, you miss some moments of the fireworks.  11. Keep a positive attitude! It will make the difference between having a good day or a bad day at Disneyland. I have to admit that I was quite frustrated with the crowds when I went back around 4pm and I was mad that we left the park at night thinking we could go back in for the fireworks. But I look at those things as a minor inconvenience to what was otherwise a great day at Disneyland.",1
26688,"Liked California Adventure best. Liked the parade at Disneyland , world of color show at California Adventure and Fantastimo water show at Disneyland",1
26689,"A trip to Disneyland is a fantastic family holiday. Rather than watch your kids enjoy themselves at a children's attraction, Disney creates a world that is also very entertaining and nostalgic for adult to participate in as well. There are wild and tame rides, shows, music, static attractions, shopping, tasty food and games. I have been there twice, once in mid May and once in late September. Crowds were low and lines were short most of the time. Sometimes we could walk on a ride within 5 minutes but during the afternoon and on weekends, the lineups were longer. It is a pricey trip but I feel that it was worth it. Take snacks and drinks as the food prices in the park are high for those items. Learn about the Fast Pass system and use it, even if you don't think the park is busy. The morning is slower, so grab passes for the afternoon, when the lines are longer. The fastpasses will indicate a timeframe to return but we found that they are actually good for that entire day. We are planning another trip for this fall. If I could afford it, I would visit the park every year.",1
26690,"It really needs planning, and several days or staggered visits to make this experience well worth while.I know of no other organization that is so professional and well run to make your visit enjoyable as long as you unnderstand there will be crowds and you need to plan your visit carefully .For us (2 grand parents,2 parents and 2 children) it worked well but we took 10 days to cover both parks, with days off in between and some days just a night visit   the 14 day day pass was excellent value to allow flexibility and breaks so not to overload which is so easy .The Fast pass system is good but was not working in several visits, luckily we were pre summer and avoided weekends.The rides were good, the parade sensational and the fireworks so good we saw them 3 times ( weekends only).Use there web site it is large but excellent and allows good planning to lower frustration.It is the happiest place in the world as they say   if you plan!!",1
26674,"This is indeed the happiest place on earth for kids but not so happy for adults. Why? get ready to pay high price for everything from parking, food, souveniers etc... The lines were long for the most popular attractions but surprisingly fast for the kiddie rides. So much to see and do in a day that I doubt you will ride and see all the attractions in the same day. I recommend to get a 2 day pass if you want to experience all the rides at this park. ",1
26673,I love everything Disney and have grown up with it. I love visiting the parks. It is the ultimate Disney experience! There is nothing like walking down Main Street U.S.A. and seeing Sleeping Beauty's Castle or getting off Pirates of the Caribbean and eating a delicious churro. Visiting Disneyland should be on everyones bucket list! ,1
26672,"Traveling with three boys   teen, tween and toddler Disneyland really delivered in terms of pleasing everyone. Three days was enough for us but we didn't see every attraction. We did plan what we wanted to see and managed to check everything off the list. I would recommend going during the week, the crowds can be overwhelming, or at least get there early an go on some of the more popular rides before the masses arrive.",1
26663,"Very expensive, but it is a great place. With the fast pass feature (it comes with your ticket) you don't have to stand in lines for hours. The characters are not just walking around like I had always thought. They only come out at certain times and are immediately surrounded by a croud. Dont' expect to get to many character pics unless you want to stand in lines. Also the food is super expensive (and not very good), a 20 oz soda is $3.50!! Walk across the street to Captain kidds buffet  you'll spend the same for all you can eat as you would for a hotdog at disney. My kids are 7&8 and they were the perfect age for this place. We did prefer California Adventure, so make sure you get the park hopper so you can go back and forth. Have fun!",1
26657,"I just bought my annual pass to Disneyland on Friday.  I went with 4 other friends and had  lots of fun.  I plan on taking my granddaughter this summer.  FUN, FUN  FUN",1
26658,"We are a family of 7, with 5 kids 10 16. We went for the kids but can honestly say I have no negative comment to make about the place & had a great time. Friendly, helpful, interested, generous   I never once felt like they were just after our money. It is as if they know they don't have to chase the customers, just look after them. (Interesting: went to Universal and Sea World & had fun but it was clear they were trying to get every dollar out of you they could). Glad we waited until the twins were 10, not sure younger and shorter would get the same value for money.Some tips that we learned for what they are worth. We purchased Southern California City pass', $270 each. 3 days at both disney parks and 1 day at Universal and 1 day at Seaworld   just in case we are not the only people in the world who did not know there are two parks at Disney (Disneyland and California Park), You need to get a two park ticket if you want to go to both. Operating times are different also, we left Disneyland (open til midnight) at 9:45pm to go to Cal World only to find out they close at 10PM. My advise is not to bother trying to get cheap tickets, we had heard Costco, etc has them but never found anything cheaper than you get on line or at the turn style. We brought tickets at booth in the hotel lobby at a quiet time, the lady gave us a detailed guide of how best to get around disneyland and use the fastpass system, her advice was priceless. For all you dads out there that need a project, mastering the fastpass is serious business, I had a ball and we rarely waited longer than 10 15 minutes for a ride. Yes...I am the self proclaimed king of fast pass. I think you need three days for disney, by the third day the kids owned the place and we were not running around but just doing the things we enjoyed. We stayed in the Marriot suites about 2 miles from the hotel. We got suites for $60 night on 'priceline.com'   you can get some bargains thru their bid site. All of the hotels run bus shuttles every half hour pretty cheap, we did that but it may be worth using the local bus system which has bus stops near by. It is the same price but allows you to travel to other places in the disney hotel district (shopping malls, restaurants, etc). There are hotels outside the entrance and connected to disney which look fantastic, if you have the money go for it. But if you can get over the perception you have to be close to the entrance (every hotel has a shuttle) then there are some great hotels at great prices. We went home every night for dinner and came back and stayed til midnight. They have photographers everywhere in the park that take you photo (for free sort of), everywhere mickey or minnie or donald are standing these photographers will be also, they scan your card and then you can buy a disk or download all of them for $70. A great service, we only found out on our last afternoon. They also have collector pins or badges, all the attendants in the park have them and will swap with you at will. Our girls loved swapping the badges, again only found out on the last day. They let you bring in food and drinks (unlike other parks). Enjoy...I am a cynic but Disney convinced me they care more about you having a great time than emptying your wallet. We went hard until midnight for three days and were still loving it. I had quality fun with my 10 yr olds thru to 16 yr old and my wife. A great family holiday.",1
26659,"It was magical, lots of rides for all the family and all the characters just made us all kids again.",1
26660,"Here's my time saving tips for an enjoyable Disney Day (we went on a Saturday in May):1. Tickets: buy them on the internet and print out your etickets to skip the line at the ticket booths. Do this at least a day in advance. It took a few hours to get our eMail. (Hotel: try the Howard Johnson within easy walking distance and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! You'll be pleasantly surprised)2. Arrival: Get there before the park opens! We got in 8 rides between 8am and 10:30am! Then the park got super crowded. If you arrive before opening, go through the main entrance. You can bring in water and snacks in a backpack. I usually drop off the crew either by the McDonalds on Harbor Dr. near the main entrance or in the Downtown Disney lot close to the Monorail station (free parking for 3 hrs). This saves them a half hour for getting through the parking lineup, parking, walk to the tram, tram ride, etc. If you arrive at or after 8, take the monorail into the park from downtown disney and skip the lines at the front gate. The monorail drops you off in tomorrowland at Nemo's sub ride and space mountain (get your fastpass!). If you go in through the main gate after 8am see if a train in coming into the station (departures every 10 minutes). This is the quick way to get to New Orleans square (the next stop) much faster than walking down main street. (Get your fast pass for Indiana Jones or Splash Mountain).3. Use the FAST PASS system and always get a new one whenever it is available (the time you can get your next fastpass is printed when you get one). Fastpasses usually sell out in roughly this order: Space Mountain, Star Tours (newly revamped), Splash Mountain, Indiana Jones, Autotopia, Thunder Mountain, Cartoon Spin. SUPER TIP  1: the cartoon spin fast pass does not count against you...you can immediately get another fast pass somewhere else. I tested this last weekend and it worked! It helps to have someone in the group be the designated fast pass runner, give that person all the tickets and have them stock up on the pastpasses as they become available. SUPER TIP  2: Fast passes don't expire! You can use them ANYTIME after the start time that same day, don't worry about the end time, they'll still let you in! So stock up as much as you can in the morning and use them in the afternoon when the lines are super long.3. Lunch: We like the French Market in New Orleans Square because it's not sit down (which takes too long) and has a good atmosphere with a jazz band playing. Look for the elevated platforms outside the restaraunt towards the water. This is a good spot for watching Fantasmic at night.4. Long lines in the afternoon: Nemo and Peter Pan always have long waits. Do these rides first thing if the lines are short or at the end of the day. Now is the time to use those fastpasses or see one of the many available shows.We like the horseshoe saloon show, get a rootbeer float. Or try the Tiki room, and get a dole whip from inside the waiting area (shorter line than outside). The  Cast Member  at the Tiki Room was really funny...hope you get him,too! Try the canoe ride (fun), the river boat rides or go exploring on Tom Sawyers island. SUPER TIP  3: For Pirates, always take the line on the right as it is much shorter than the line on the left which wraps around the side of the building. (I picked the wrong line the first time...but the second time I picked the RIGHT line!) You can also ride Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones as a  single rider . Check with the  Cast Member  and the entrance and go through the exit to line up. Even these lines were long the day we went, though. 5. Parade and Small World: SUPER TIP 4: The first parade starts at It's a small world. Plan on getting there just at start time (don't wait for hours trying to stake out a good spot on the parade route). Go in the line on the right. You'll be the first to see the parade and when it's over, there is no line to get onto the Small World ride. The later Parade starts on Main Street and ends at Small World.6. Pirates, Haunted House or Night Time Splash Mountain: The best time to ride these are when fantasmic is showing. Minimal waiting! 7. Fantasmic. Try the bridge over Pirates or the elevated platform outside the French Market, If these areas are full, go down by the haunted house where there is usually more room. As fantasmic or the fireworks are ending quickly go into Pirates, Haunted house or Splash mountain. Alternatively, ride the train to tomorrowland to skip the crowds exiting the area.With these tips, I counted 28 rides shows that we were able to do in one day including 3 splash mountains, 3 thunder mountains, 3 space mountains and 2 pirates. The key was to get there early and stay until closing. Disney is still a great value for all the fun and entertainment you get....even if they did just raise the prices again. Next week, we are off to California adventure using the second half or our SoCal 2 fer deal. Stay tuned for more tips and let me know if these were helpful with your votes!",1
26661,"If you like disney you have to go, as simple as that.  Try to go when school is out so you wont have to fight the crowds.  It closes earlier, but you can do more stuff.",1
26662,"Those of us with homes in Southern California have typically visited Disneyland a bunch of times. It's been around 15 years since we've been there, but this time was different. We're a bit older and now we have grandchildren to take. 7 year old Ashlee and her 6 year old brother, AJ are visiting from Baton Rouge Louisiana. It's funny how they've never visited a Disney theme park but they sure knew what they wanted to see. Especially Ashlee. It was actually fun riding on the  kiddy  rides instead of our usual haunts like Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, and others. The Matterhorn was closed for some major work. With all the walking and watching parades and fireworks, there was something new for me. We ate lunch at a nice Mexican restaurant in Frontierland called Rancho del Zocalo. The food was great and the price was very reasonable for being at a theme park. I guess this place hasn't lost its touch. Many things have changed over the years, but the fun is still here. The lines moved amazingly well. We had originally planned to visit the kids and take them over to Disney World in Orlando but they won't know what they missed anyway. Plan your trip ahead of time! You already know that it's an all day affair even if just visiting Disneyland. There's also California Adventure and Downtown Disney for more adult oriented entertainment. The kids didn't wear us out but I think we all slept well that night.",1
26664,"Disneyland was absolutely wonderful. This was our first trip and we throughly enjoyed it. I will say, however, that after frequenting Disney World so many times, Disneyland seems a little small...",1
26671,Take the time to spend several days here. So much to do and see. My family enjoyed every minute!! The Cast members go above and beyond and are super polite. Every cast member addressed my 3 yr old daughter as Princess. Made her day! Cannot wait to go back!!,1
26665,"Wow, money is just like water as it pours out your hands. But fun.",1
26666,Disneyland in Anaheim is a perfectly clean park. The castmembers (employees) are very friendly and helpful. The rides have the same names as the ones in Magic Kingdom in Orlando but differ enough to be surprised anyway. Although smaller than the younger bigger brother in Florida we found the rides as fun as over there and liked the shorter walks in between the attractions. It looks like this park even have more rides than the one in Orlando. The Disney atmosfere is great. We found it easy to find healthy choices of food in this park and were amazed by the little waits before we could ride an attraction.,1
26667,"Disneyland, need I say more?  We had a wonderful time at Disneyland, and we cannt wait to return.",1
26668,"I have made many trips here, and not once has the standard dropped in any way, a truly amazing place, my first visit was 100 per cent perfect, so when asked to return i was not keen, did not want to spoil the image of my first outing there, But the next and many more visits was as the first. And the Christmas Disney, wow.",1
26669,"My wife and daughter make a Disneyland trip at least twice a year and we never get tired of it! The park is always clean and every year we find either a new attraction or a new twist to an old classic. If you eat at Blue Bayou in the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction, ask for Maria   she's a great server!",1
26670,Always the best family vacation  A family tradition,1
26691,What do you say. Everything was spot on. I'd been there before but my wife hadn't. We stayed for the Grand Parade and Fanfasmic. If I had to complain I'd say   to many kids  ..........LOL.  A fantastic place.,1
26692,"Disneyland, itself, is wonderful; but you have to wonder how so many people can be wheelchair bound. It's frustrating to see folks abuse the 'handicapped' title. I understand Disneyland is trying to put the brakes on this practice, but it's discouraging. Also, now much of the park is also in Spanish. It was certainly not the joyous experience we had there years ago. ",1
26693,"Disneyland is a blast. Great rides, lots to see and do for kids of all ages.   Take advantage of a 3 day hopper pass and also visit California Adventure.",1
26719,"I love Disney   I am 35  and I still think that Disneyland is a great place to spend a day (and yes I have also been to Disney World). Being an annual passholder it is slightly different for me as I can 'pop' in and out of the park without having to get my monies worth every trip. However, I am going to base this on it being a one day visit as I think most people will find that type of review more helpful.First   if you are on holiday and have a choice go on a weekday. Weekends are obviously busier and you will want to make the most of your time, when the park is busy you can spend a lot of time in queues.Second   comfort not fashion. If you are there early to make the most of the day, and stay till late to see Fantasmic and the fireworks (highly recommended) then you need to wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Take a few layers, as in the evening except in the height of summer it can get cold. There are storage lockers available   different sizes cost different amounts (when I took my parents a reasonable sized one was $7 for the day and it was definately worth it).Third   plan! Fast passes are only available on a select number of rides, most of the bigger adult type rides, and you can only get one every couple of hours. The children rides can be busier than the adult rides (just because of the child adult ratio of visitors) so try and do those child rides earlier in the day and yes even as an adult the child rides are fun.Couple of other notes; Food can be expensive in the park and only a couple of places offer relatively nutritious options (however it's a theme park so what do you expect and milk, fruit and so on can be purchased). There is a picnic place outside the park so you can bring your own (and in out passes are possible if you get your hand stamped when you leave the park). Pick up a show times leaflet on going into the park   if you want to see a show get there early and people do line up for the parades and the fireworks crazily early. People have mentioned in reviews about never seeing characters or seeing minimal   I have to say I have never had that problem. There are always characters at certain times of the day (noon time and late night in the City Hall area are sure bets) if you are not sure ask a staff member.At a last mention   suspend disbelief, it is so much better if you just believe in the Disney magic (I refuse to allow people to talk about possible behind the scenes goings on when I am there). To me this is a place where people are happy and things are colorful and fun and if you do the same then I think it adds something extra to the day.",1
26713,go in May our line up waits during the week were 5 10 minutes thats all.   Very hard to find the locations that give free refills,1
26714,"Disney is amazing! It just brightens my day. Toy story Mania is my favorite ride. Your day really all depends on which day you go and which cast members are working. Ive had some pretty bad days there but most of the time it is wonderful! They really need to do something about this one girl named Airy who works at the mexican food place in CA adventures. She needs to cheer up and be a little nicer, but again most of the employees are great!",1
26715,"We were with our nephews at Disneyland, it is a step above all other theme parks. A few years ago we visited Knotts Berry Farm, the bathrooms had been vandalized, many of the rides seemed like they were for teenagers only,it did not seem like the family park I remembered previously. In Disneyland you always feel safe.The new Star Tours was especially fun for all. They changed the old one so that now there are several outcomes for each trip. Toy Story Mania (actually in California Adventure Park)was another favorite, although the rides like Pirates, Big Thunder Mountain, and Space Mountain continue to be popular attractions as well. Food was expensive, but it was always good. Wear good walking shoes, you'll need them. The monorail takes you to downtown Disney where there are some good restaurants. ESPN Zone and Tortilla Joe's were fairly reasonable and had good food. We'll likely go back once California Adventure has the new Carsland open.",1
26716,beautiful restaurant inside the 'pirates of the carribean' ride  pricey but good service and way beyone theme park food,1
26717,It was my first visit.  I was amazed.  Everyone was so nice and believable.  I cried when my daughter met the princesses.  They were so real.  I've spent 3 days there and must say would stay longer if only I could.,1
26718,"As usual the trip down is always with great anticipation. I have been going to Disneyland California since I was 5 I am now 48. This particular trip was for my two 5 year old grandsons'. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed in DL, their computors credit card machines where down all day so using a credit card was very inconvenient. It wasn't impossible, but took longer if you used it. They say it is the happiest place on earth..............I beg to differ. Our first ride we waited in the line that stated on the sign it was 10 mins at that point........20 mins into it the ride breaks and we are told to come back. Try telling that to 5 year olds! They should have some type of way to ensure that we could come back and by pass the line to get in....but they didn't. (I know thay didn't know that was our first ride) but it would have been nice to get some compensation for our wasted wait. Most of the employees are very nice, some are just cordial. There was one particular salesperson that really stood out. Kudos to him!!!! Most ride lines were tollerable, but in a 12 hour day we still only managed to get in 12 rides. The food is really only mediocre at best and expensive and you can't take your own in. They have signs posted to re hydrate often (which is great) however the water from the drinking fountains is warm, not very tasty and they don't work well. Bottled water is expensive. They really get ya not matter what! It would be nice if you could at least bring your own water or sell it for a bit less!",1
26720,"What needs to be said?  It's Disneyland!  California Adventure is under construction right now, so bear that in mind if you are planning a trip soon.",1
26711,"What could I say that would sway you into going or not going? Nothing. It's Disneyland. You are going to go, you are going to pay a fortune to go, eat and do anything there and your kids are going to love it!",1
26721,"Everything , rides fun some old but still enjoyable, good variety.",1
26722,"A place where the is something for everyone from young to old.  Great value for money.  It can be exhausting, definately worth spreading it out over a quite a dew days.",1
26725,"Disney is still great for families with kids, although I would highly recommend going on a weekday before summer. We usually go in late February on a Thursday and it's nearly empty (for Disney).Usually eating outside of the park is much cheaper and quicker. We usually go to Napoli and three of us eat for $20. One thing I wish Disney installed is cell phone chargers! It's almost impossible to find an outlet and when your phone is your camera, camcorder and clock, it's dead all day!",1
26726,"I visited here from England 18 months ago, and wanted to come because it's the original park that Walt himself saw being built. It's great!! The rides are suitable for kids, teenagers, and adults! We didn't have to queue for very long either. Favourite rides were; Dumbo, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Carribean, Splash Mountain and the Matterhorn!Also loved the Fantasmic show!Loads of opportunities to meet and greet characters as well :) Loved every minute.",1
26727,Truely a wonderful experience to visit Disneyland. The atmosphere can't help but make you smile often.I was somewhat dissappointed with California Adventure. There seems to be a lot of wasted space and a lot of walkihg between attractions. From Grizzly Bear to Arial there are nice looking buildings that seem to do nothing. I also don't understand the arcade area. That does nothing for me. I would prefer to see more rides.The new section looks like it will be a fun addtion. I'm looking forward to my next visit to see how it all turns out.,1
26728,"2nd time we have been here (last time in 2010)   always have a ball.Lines were pretty nuts this time (last saturday in April), so missed out on my favourite Indiana Jones. (90 minute wait)Also missed out on the Matterhorn for the 2nd time (it was closed in 2010 as well)However, had lots of fun. Did the star wars space tour for the first time, as well as favourites such as the Pirates of the Carribean.Long, tiring, but incredibly fun day had by all!!!!",1
26712,No bad experiences are allowed at Disneyland are there.  We lucked out this time and on our Friday visit the crowds were light.  Saturday was  little more crowded but with fast passes things always work out.,1
26710,"My family purchased a 4 day hopper pass. On Wednesday night, 5 9 12, we were taken off of the line for Space Mountain after waiting for 25 minutes due to  technical difficultes. The next morning, my kids were eager to hit Indiana Jones first. We entered the park and headed right over to the Indy ride, only to find it was shut down due to  technical difficulties.  We headed over to California Adventure to hit Soarin', only to find guests being escorted OFF the ride due to what we were told were  technical difficulties.  So we went on over to the Toy Story ride which was shut down to   you guessed it, TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. Later that Thursday night we headed back to Disneyland to go on Roger Rabbit's Cartoon spin. After waiting on line for over 20 minutes, we were told the ride was no operating due to technical difficulties. Finally that night, we went to go back on Indy to find it AGAIN shut down. This was ALL ON THURSDAY, 5 10.The following day, Friday 5 11, the Buzz Lightyear ride was closed around 8pm for reasons the cast member by the entrance could not tell me. Then, we headed over to the Star Tours ride to get FastPass, and we were told by a cast member that Fast Pass for this ride was not available because they ran out of tickets. We paid over $800 for a 4 day hopper pass and lost out on about a day and a half worth of rides. I intend to chase down some of my money back. We normally go to Disney World every year but decided to give DisneyLAND a try. What a dissapointment. ",1
26694,"Disneyland is always fun, especially when the lines aren't too long.  It was a great time to go and spend time with my family.  the only thing is it's so expensive.  The food prices are outrageous.  Overall a good time.",1
26701,"Disney is great!!! But Beware of this guy TAJI, a Disney cast member working at the trams. He is rude, arrogant and will ruin your Disney vacation. I recommend Disney to remove this guy, he does not deserve to work there. Thanks.",1
26695,"Wasn't too crowded this time, weather was beautiful, kinda chilly at night bring a jacket!",1
26696,"Disney parks are on a league of their own .... its a surreal place!A few tips for the park: Get your fast passes for the main attractions as queues are too long during the day.You can buy packages that give you access to some attractions before the park opens for the publicBe organised and ahead of time for parades and shows as little one may be disappointed and some times they can't see anything when the public starts to gather aroundSome restaurants give you deals and better seating for some attractionsFood can be expensiveCheck which rides are open at the time that you are going as some of the main ones where closed and we were quite disappointedBe patient ! there is a line and people everywhere for anything you want to do !If you have a little girl MAKE SURE you check the dress up boutique in Fantasy land ! A must for every girl !and just go with it   after all, its Disneyland !",1
26697,We just returned from four days in Disneyland and it was wonderful as always!  Disney knows how to do everything top notch!,1
26698,"Disneyland is Disneyland. I hadn't been there for about 5 years and there were new things to see and enjoy. Unfortunately, the Easter crowds weren't one of them but you can't blame Disney for that! The Magic was still there   especially watching it in the eyes of my godson. You can never go wrong at Disneyland!",1
26699,"I finally fullfilled my childhood dream and went to disneyland..........it was everything i thought it would be and then some..it is quite expensive but hey its a once in a lifetime thing..for me anyway. Plan you route so you dont miss anything, lining up can be a drag but there is a multitude of things to see and do.",1
26700,"I'm probably the wrong person for this review. I love just about everything Disney. Therefore, I'm biased.",1
26702,"I have been going to Disneyland since I was a little girl. I have such good memories. The park has changed over the 55  years I've been going, and while it is much more expensive and crowded it is still a great place to go. We loved taking our children and now our grandchildren (they are 15 and 12yrs). We never go in the summer (we live only 2hrs away) and never go on the weekend. Go early in the day, ride all the big rides first because it gets more crowded as the day goes on. The  Cast  (staff) are extremely friendly and helpful. It is family friendly and clean. I can not say enough good about this place. Be prepared to spend a lot of money, but I think you will feel it is worth it.",1
26709,I love Disneyland our 2 year old loved it. He was able to ride on most rides and enjoyed it. May is a good time to go. We got there early and rode on many rides before it got busy. We will be back but not until he can do the  big  rides. ,1
26703,"awesome location, awesome hotels, awesome attractions...  the price is high, but the experience is priceless  )",1
26704,"Everything you hear about Disneyland, is true.  Everyone must experience this place at least once in their life.  This was our first time here (3adults, 3 kids), and I'm sure we will be going back.",1
26705,"I was born and grew up in Orange County; I'm the same age as Disneyland and first visited it at age 5. Once I left California, I didn't return again until last week, 33 years later! My sister and her daughter flew in from Texas and I flew in from Ohio; we booked a hotel across the street and celebrated my niece's 12th birthday in style at Disneyland. We went on a Thursday....it was beautiful weather and uncrowded; we just walked onto many of the most popular rides with no waiting (we arrived as soon as the park opened; it did get more crowded around noon). Some old favorites of mine (Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion) were just as wonderful as they were in the 70s! My niece had her favorites (Indiana Jones, Space Mountain) that we rode no less than 3 times. And the snacks were excellent, just as I remembered them (especially the frozen chocolate banana on a stick....yummy!) We had the best time, and I think my niece will always remember her birthday!",1
26706,"This is a great park if you know all the tricks. It is sad to read about so many people spending a fortune on food and waiting in long lines because it just doesn't have to be that way if you know the place well...Trick 1   bring lots of snacks. Park food is really pricey and not all that healthy (although it is a lot better than it was 10 years ago). Rather than paying a fortune for food during your visit, eat snacks like apples, carrot sticks, sandwiches, and jucie in the lines during the day and then go for one good meal in the evening. Trick 2   Go early. If you can stay in a park hotel and enter an hour before everyone else, that is ideal, but if you are only going for a day, enter the parks as soon as they open and visit the popular rides before they become really crowded. This makes a big difference.Trick 3   understand how fastpass works. There is never a reason to wait in a long line in this park if you plan well. Almost all of the rides with long lines have fastpass as an option. This system is most helpful if used heavily during the first half of the day.Trick 4   flee at peak time. When the park is crammed, go and chill out. There is no point in enduring the mobs that hit the park between 1pm and 3pm. Run away. There are lots of attractions that are both air conditioned and easy to walk into like Tiki Room and Captain Eo. If you have a park hopper pass, California Adventure has more of lots of these sorts of rides (bugs life and muppets). And if you are staying at one of the hotels, remember most have good themed spas, pools and activites. Go have a rest and come back for the evening as the park starts to get quieter. If you can, fast pass one ride before you leave that has a long lag time on the fast pass so you can walk back into the park two or three hours later and immediately jump onto another ride.Trick 6   be aware of which rides have slow lines and which rides have fast ones. As an example, Peter Pan has a very slow queue and can have painfully long lines by midday. The same is true of Space and Splash Mountain. In contrast, Pirates, Small World and Haunted Mansion move people through quickly and rarely have wait times that are anywhere near as long. Use this information to prioritise the rides you visit during the day. Always visit slow line rides as early as you can or fastpass them.",1
26707,Disneyland was AWESOME. Will definitely return. It was all I'd ever hoped for.,1
26708,"I cannot praise our experience at Disneyland any higher. The Cast (the staff) help make it a magical experience. Two in particular when we were there   Ariel on the Alice in Wonderland Ride, and Michael who was working on the Princess Faire queue. They were awesome!!!My daughters had a ball, and a magical experience.Use the Fastpass system, it was a lifesaver.",1
26656,"Went Thursday through Saturday. Thursday, never waited more than 30 min. for any ride. Friday, the crouds picked up and Saturday it was extremely busy. But, that is what I would expect from Disneyland. No complaints and the cast memebers we encountered were very helpful and cheerful.",1
26652,"Disneyland Park is a wonderful delight. Of course it has a lot to live up to always being compared to Disney World. First Disneyland is much smaller than Disney World. It has just as many rides as the Magic Kingdom in Florida, just more compact. So this can make it less stressful on your feet, but the crowds can seem overwhelming. Must do Rides  Use Fastpass where available. Even when the park isn't too busy you can ride your favorite ride several times by utilizing Fastpass.Space Mountain, yes it is a roller coaster but the thrills come from the ride being in the dark and from sharp turns, rather than big drops.Indiana Jones, this ride is a unique experience and one you can't find in Florida. You are in a  jeep  going through Indiana's adventures. The ride is mostly bumpy with no drops.Haunted Mansion, This ride is slow and suitable for anyone who doesn't like the big thrill rides. Although it may scare small children as it is a haunted mansion. The ghosts don't jump out and scare but dance around, talk and go about their day. This ride is just very unique as you look around at all the ghostly action. You can see something new each time you ride.Splash Mountain, You may get wet, but on a hot day you will dry pretty fast. This ride is pretty mellow besides the big drop and has a wonderful story following Brer Rabbit. On a hot day, Fastpass is a must.Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, This is a roller coaster but without the large drops. When you are descending down you are turning and twisting your way down. Fantasmic!  This is a wonderful show with water, fire, several Disney Characters, boats, movie and live action. The whole family will love it. It is definitely worth it to get there early and get a spot to watch the show.Overall Disneyland Park is a clean, friendly park. It doesn't have all the pizzazz of Disneyworld but it was built by Disney himself. If you are a big Disney fan you will appreciate the history in the park and probably have a bit of fun too.",1
26572,What is there not to like about Disneyland?  Rides were great.  Weather was great.  Loved it.,1
26651,We recetly vistited California and after a 12 year absence we couldn't wait to get back to our Fav place ever!!Disneyland!!Not quite what I rememberd with a new parking garage and alot more walking but it is well worth the time spent there!!Go early!!It opens at 8 am!!Bring Water with you and you'll be loveing the escalator and write down were you parked!!!,1
26593,"like  princesses and rides for my 2 female companions, fireworks for me.",1
26595,We have been to Disney World many times but Disneyland is much more laid back and manageable. There is still time to enjoy the pool!,1
26596,"Very exciting day at Disneyland Park, CA. We were able to get to the park early enough to avoid long lines. Be prepared to walk alot,and wait for the rides. I haven't been there in 30 years, it has the same ambience as before, and beauty undescribeable. ",1
26597,"Fun for all ages, very organized, even on the day the whole park system was down.",1
26598,"i love disneyland and california park their awesome!!!!!!!!!!!! i have the deluxe annual pass because i love it so much i go for 3 days a month. The annual passes went up this year that's the down side but it is worth it all the rides, characters, food, family memories and lots of fun.",1
26599,"Disneyland is awesome, plain and simple. Yes there will be lines, and a lot of people. Yes, the food is  expensive . Yes, parking is far away and sometimes things are closed. But it's Disneyland!! If you have kids, they will have fun and so will you. Pro tip: Take advantage of the FASTPASS(i believe that's what it's called) system. Basically, what this does is a way to preplan what you want to ride and skip the lines. It works like this: Say you want to ride Thunder Mountain, but the line is 1hr long. Go to the FASTPASS dispensers, put in your ticket and it will give you another ticket. This ticket will have a time range, at which you can return and skip the line at that point. This allows you to go do other things instead of waiting in line. Not every ride has this, but all the major rides do.So enjoy, have fun and don't worry about the people and prices too much. Just have fun.P.S. I would avoid the Autopia (not really fun, and you just smell exhaust), Finding Nemo (super long lines, minimal enjoyment), and Roger Rabbits CarToon Spin (SUPER SUPER LONG LINE, real short ride)",1
26600,"there's nothing really to dislike but maybe crowds. If you choose a less popular time its better, It is a wonderful place to visit, and fun n happy place to b a kid an a kid all over again.",1
26602,"Disney is unique, but it is not a thrill ride park compared to others. If you are pushing babies in a stroller, you will be ready for suicide by the end of the day. DO NOT bring your babies! Withhold the urge until they are old enough to get around on their own. Our kids were actually 14 and 19, and loved it as part of our overall SoCal trip. The other main tips I have is to NOT eat there, maybe 1 snack. And the biggest tip is to pull your kids out of school and come during the week. We went in mid May during the week and it was plenty crowded. Locals told me that was a very samll crowd compared to normal, and we had 40 minute waits for the main rides. Always smallerr crowds early in the morning and late in the day. So get a big breakfast off site, go for the morning, go back to the hotel for a rest and lunch, then go later in the day until close. Be warned there is even a line for getting pics with Disney characters, which were not bad lines, but a short wait. For pics with characters wait until late at night when all the people who brought their little kids are gone.",1
26603,"the classes were good but could be more i think, I am not sure that they realize that when a teacher books them, they are really wanting an indepth class in the area they book.",1
26604,I've been to Disneyland before but it was when I was younger. It was still as magical as before and the food that we ate in the park was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend the Gumbo in New Orleans Square. I forget the name of the restaurant though...,1
26605,"Rides, characters, parades, sunshine, treats. What more could anyone ask for on vacaton?",1
26608,Disneyland is incredible. We did both parks in one day but it took 14 hours so I would recommend making it a two day hopper pass deal. Must see.,1
26609,"As long as you get in early and have a plan   it works pretty much like clockwork. Leave in the afternoon   evenings are crazy! I am actually glad they are raising the prices on the Season Passes for locals, as that is what makes all the craziness. Most of the tourists are very polite, the young adults there on season passes run around the park, run when they open the different areas, and generally are oblivious to manners.",1
26612,"Friendly knowledgeable staff, great rides and atmosphere. Perfect for the young and young at heart. I wouldn't go middle of the summer on a weekend. But Disney is so great with entertainment and ride ques that long waits don't seem so bad. I appreciate the Fast Pass program that Disney has in place. It gives everyone a fair chance Other than charging $50 extra like other parks do. We always plan a next vacation to Disney as soon as we finish the last. Counting down the days....",1
26613,"A lovely place ! been there from 7am to 11pm.  Pros: Scenery, Attractions, Parade, Disney's characters, Fireworks  Cons: Queue (crazy in July, even with fast pass), Merchandise is really disappointing, repeat itself in every store even if the store looks different.",1
26591,"Amazing rides ,shows and of course the fireworks.The park is very clean and tidy with lots to see and do.",1
26589,"All the rides there were very exciting. All the rides were fun in their own way. It's very beautiful and We had a very magical expenerience. I can't really decide on a favorite ride overall...... I found all of them pretty cool. I had a very good day and I hope the same to you, too. Even though this is our second visit to Disneyland , after the one at HK, yet... It was fresh.. And entertaining even though many rides were the same.",1
26588,"Disneyland is always wonderful, but if you can... avoid going on days that they have Grad Night (late May). Many years ago, Grads used to arrive after the park closed and enjoyed the park by themselves. Now, the Grads start arriving around 6pm. After 6 it was impossible to find a ride that did not have an hour (or more) wait. Even rides we had Fast Passes for were slow. We also had to deal with a lot (A LOT) of excited, noisy, yelling teenagers in large groups. Mornings and afternoons were great. We still had fun   but had we known it would be like this, we may have gone somewhere else.",1
26579,"Travelling with my wife and two young children,our recent trip to DiISNEYLAND was by far the BEST family vacation we've been on (and that includes three trips to Hawaii in the past 3 years)!!We were travelling with 2 young children (4 and 2 years old), but we all loved it so much that we spent an average of 10 hours per day in the parks and we visited the park on 7 consecutive days   thats how much we all loved it!We were apprehensive about booking this vacation because of the age of our kids, but we collectively had the BEST times of our lives!!!!We stayed at a hotel close walking distance to the Parks and that allowed us to spend a few hours there in the morning, walk back to the hotel for naps and pool time and then a short walk back to the parks for a few more hours of fun!If travelling with small children, I strongley reccomend staying at a nice hotel close to the Park (we stayed at the Sheraton Park Hotel).The kids loved meeting the characters, going on rides and seeing all the wonder that is Disneyland! Cant wait to go back!if you are questioning taking young children, I say GO FOR IT! Have reasonable expectations and plan your trip well, but the kids loved it   right up to the late night fireworks!!",1
26573,"I love Disneyland! We visited to see my 17 year old daughter's choir perform, but we spent most of our time with our 19 month old daughter. My husband had recent surgery on his foot, so we rented and electric scooter. All of the Disney staff were great. We got to go thru the exits on the rides, which was nice because we didn't have to stand in long lines. Disneyland has such a nice feel about it. Everyone truly is happy, you can leave LOADED strollers sitting alone for an hour and nobody touches anything. The parade is awesome and staff went out of their way during the parade and during Fantasmic to make sure we got a good place to sit with the scooter. We did character dining the first day, and that was very fun for my little one. We did get a table that was a little out of the way so the characters missed us a couple of times. But when they did come, they were very patient with our baby girl and made sure that we got plenty of pictures. I can't wait until our next visit!",1
26574,"Disneyland really is the happiest place on earth!! Every time I go it gets better and better. When ever I want to go on a vacation I think Disneyland. And every time I go I discover new things that I love about the park. Last time I went I found the Disney Gallery. To get there take a left right when you go into the park it is next to Great Moments with Abraham Lincoln. If you want to find out about the history of Disneyland and collect Disneyland memorabilia you have to stop here. There are original concepts of Disneyland, a video that go's through the history of Disneyland, old park tickets, trains from Walt, paintings and posters of Disneyland, miniature figurines of Disney park old and new, and much much more. In my opinion that is a must see especially if you like the history of Disneyland like me!",1
26575,"We loved everthing about Disneyland, go off peak Jan Feb and short or no line ups for the rides.",1
26576,"I have always loved going to Disneyland. However,  the food in the park was good but pricey, the rides are fun but the lines are long, and I need about 2 more days to see every thing cuz I pooped out after about 8 hours.......",1
26577,"with all the new additions to California Adventure and the upgrades at Disneyland, it is a great time to check out the parks!",1
26578,"Bigger than I remember, Adventure California was great and the attendants were great.",1
26580,My family was captivated by all the star wars stuff and got our youngest generation hooked on Michael Jackson's Captain EO. NEVER LET THAT GO!!! Another amazing visit to the happiest place on earth.  VIVA BEIGNETS AND CHURROS!,1
26587,This is one of my favorite parks! Literally something for everyone in our group from senior citizens to my 7 year old!,1
26581,"Disneyland boasts many wonderful rides and shows, starting with the parking lot tram ride. Parking costs about $12.00 per car, but the parking lot tram ride is free and has no age or height or health restriction! I've always wondered why we're warned to keep our head, arms, and legs from hanging over the side of the tram, which still gives us the liberty to jut our buttocks. Whatever. Entry into the parks (Disneyland on one side, California Adventure on the other) costs more and more each time I look, but I remind myself that I'm buying a ticket to the Happiest Place on Earth, which I guess is priceless. The amusement park rides and Disney themed live shows are classics, with tweaks every few decades to keep them fresh. Costumed  cast members  walk around, pose for photos, and participate in the parades. The lines for the more popular rides may take an hour or longer, so consider eating lunch or singing  It's a Small World After All  repeatedly while waiting. Park policy does not allow customers to bring food into the park, and FYI food sold within the park is marked up significantly; on the other hand, it is the Happiest Food on Earth. By the way, I'd rate the taste of the food an A (for Average) and the its health value a B (for BAD). Some parts of the line are non shaded, so bring a hat and sunblock to prevent getting the Happiest Skin Cancer on Earth. Of course, you could buy a Goofy hat there but again bring lots of money. The park is large enough such that, in theory, one could get good walking exercise; in reality, the foot traffic, parades, numerous attractions, and ubiquitous snack stalls make continuous walking impossible for more than a few minutes at a time. Nearly every ride deposits customers into a store bursting with colorful plastic trinkets for sale, certain to bring joy to toddlers everywhere. Non asthmatics should stay for the evening fireworks show. Disneyland knows how to put on a magical show and make lots of profit. But money isn't everything, and how much would you spend to make a child's dream come true?",1
26582,"It is really the happiest place on earth, especially when your'e rating the smiles on your childrens faces!!",1
26583,"Disneyland is our favorite place to visit. We live in Texas and don't get to go as often as we would like, but anytime we are able to go on a vacation this is where we go. Our last trip was in April 2012 and it was our 2 year old's first visit. She has talked about nothing else since we got back and almost cries asking if we can go back. For us it is truly the Happiest Place on Earth. We forget about all the troubles in our life when we are there. There is plenty for all ages to do. The cast members go out of their way to make your visit magical. It is important to plan your trip, making dining reservations, knowing how Fast Passes work, etc. Do not miss Fantasmic!, it is the greatest show ever made. For character dining I would recommend the Minnie and Friends breakfast at the Plaza Inn inside Disneyland park. We saw 24 characters during our breakfast and they took a lot of time to really interact with our children.",1
26584,"Wow, what a fabulous place   everything was so clean and perfect!!  Three days for Disney and California Adventure combined were spot on.  Our children are 6 & 8 and went on almost all of the rides, we had an absolute ball   highly recommend!!!!",1
26585,"Always something new and different, we bring family and friends here all the time. Finally got our Premier Passes, YAY!!!",1
26586,"My boys were both picked to train with the Jedi Academy. They loved Star Tours. They jolted us to the bone in Autopia. And they hated Space Mountain  it was their first roller coaster. Pirates of the Caribbean was seen twice. One boy lost a hat on the ride, one lost his hat into the river while waiting for the first boy to try to find his. The Pirates' staff were wonderful. They fished out the second boy's hat and told us how to go to Lost and Found. All in all, we had wonderful service from the cast members, especially the one who helped us to find seats in the reserved section for the Fantasmic show, so my boys could see. I wish we had more than one day. It was wonderful. And Lost and Found had the hat. ",1
26614,"Maybe I'm biased   but I still like Disneyland far better than Disney World. Disneyland is still  home  to me (I now live 4,000 miles away but it's worth the trip). It will be a year and a half before I can return again but I can't wait to see the new  Cars  addition to the CA Adventure next time. ",1
26615,we travelled here back in 2008 not as per selected down here.,1
26616,"By the end of the day, my five year old daughter was exhausted from all the fun. The rides, the lightshow. Be aware that the fireworks can get cancelled because of non perfect weather and the queues can be over 40 mintues long during peak times. I have been unlucky enough to have had rides break down as well. I does not matter, I asked my daughter, what was the best part: she said  ALL OF IT  !",1
26642,"Disney does a wonderfull job of creating a magical experience for the kids. My 6 & 9 year old had a blast. All the rides were in great shape and the staff were for the most part fantastic. Food is a bit on the expensive side in the park, but if you don't mind walking for 5 mins outside the park food can be found that is much more reasonably priced. Would definately recomend that you try and go for a few days during the week if possible as it gets very, very busy on weekends. Also take advantage of the fast pass system. The kids can't wait to go again.",1
26636,try the new attractions like cars and in the night for the drink social people they are going to open the T mad party.,1
26637,Being from New Zealand going to Disneyland isn't something you get to do very often (a 16 hour flight kind of makes it a bit inconvenient). We visited as a family with a six year old and an eight year old and it was just spectacular. Disneyland is certainly one place that does live up to your expectations! We spent three days (two days Disneyland and one day California Adventure) and it was just perfect. We had two character dining meals (Goofy's Kitchen dinner and Minnie's Picnic in the Park) which I highly recommend if you want to interact with characters and we also ate at the BBQ in Disneyland which was really good. Definitely arrive at the park before opening to get as many rides in before it gets busy.I want to live at Disneyland! It is with huge sadness that I come to terms with the realisation that it may have been the only time I go there!,1
26638,Loved Disneyland Park. We unfortunately hit a very very busy weekend and couldn't' get many rides in. I look forward to visiting the park again when my kids are a bit older.,1
26639,"We went early in December 2011 and had a 4 day hopper. It wasn't enough time to do everything we wanted to do but because of the smaller crowds, we got to ride many of the main rides many times. Sometimes we'd be able to get off one ride and get back in line with a less than 10 minute wait to ride again. The fireworks were cancelled on our first night there due to high winds but we stayed to watch them every other night.I agree with many of the other posters about the wonderful things to do and see at DL so won't repeat them. I skipped and sang my way through the lands, loved Tom Sawyer's Island for the rest it gave us while the kids explored the 'caves', couldn't get enough of the Mickey Bars, and loved Billy Hill and the Hillbillies!My negatives   I didn't like a lot of the food but the chowder in New Orleans Square was great. And the churros. Every time my family went off to ride something I didn't, I'd scope out the nearest churro stand :)My positives   the characters and the cast members who go out of their way to make you feel like you are the most important person in the world. I can't wait to go back.",1
26640,"We are Disney freaks   loved everything! It is a magical place with something, we believe, for everyone. Love the feeling, rides, food (little costly however), cleanliness, fireworks, shows, people watching. Great place for families.",1
26641,"Was wonderful at Christmas, perfect for a first visit.",1
26643,Felt like I was 10 years old again!!!  My husband and I visited for 2 days and had a great time.  Really made me miss my kids and grandkids but we will try and take them in the next few years!!,1
26634,"What else is there to say?  Our girl had a great time meeting several Disney Princesses, having breakfast with Minnie and meeting Mickey in his house.  Great time!",1
26644,We went for the day with our kids. It was great. We went back to the Disney downtown the next night and it was fun.,1
26646,"I'm a Disney Fan ... and the history at Disneyland gives it an element that the other Disney Parks can't match.  Go early, stay late.  Use the FastPass system.  Have fun!",1
26647,Disneyland is the happiest place on earth...Castmembers do an outstanding job of helping to create a magical experience.  Don't forget to get your 'birthday' or 'I'm celebrating' button.,1
26648,"The main things that I like about Disneyland is that there is always something new and fun to do. They have it down! They know how to handle crowds and there is so much to do you would have to work hard to have a bad time. We, as always, were there from opening to closing and left very happy....and tired! Thanks Disney!",1
26649,"I think Disney does a great job of protecting some Nostalgic, memorable parts of the park while moving forward. I feel I can always count on them to put quality behind everything they do. Over the last several years, they've done a great job of improving the quality of the food they offer in the park. The addition of Fast Passes to the most popular rides means you don't spend your entire day standing in line. My advice to new visitors is to take time to appreciate everything the park has to offer beyond the fantastic rides. The best way to enjoy your day is to pace yourself, enjoy the bands and singers that are stationed throughout the park, and let it be ok if you don't get to do everything. Disneyland isn't just any old theme park, there's so much to take in and enjoy, you miss a lot if you just rush from ride to ride.",1
26650,"After not being to Disneyland since 1999, I was amazed at the changes Disney has done to the park. I thought it would be the same and would be a bit disappointed, however, that was not the case. Many changes over the years made this vacation all new.",1
26635,"Spent only one day...really could have used two. The park is clean, there are bathrooms everywhere (great with a 3 year old), and it's smaller and easier to get around than WDW. We had no wait for most of the rides...walked right on to Splash and Thunder Mountains! My 3 year old had a blast...2 year old was too young to really enjoy it.",1
26633,"I took my first trip there last week. Yes, at 37 yrs. young, I have never been. It was the most amazing time I have ever had. I took my wife and my 9 year old daughter and we all loved it! The attention to detail is Epic to say the least. With thousands of people walking arround, I had a hard time finding any trash on the ground, or even a dirty bathroom. Total sensory overload and it was AWESOME!! I will definately go back very soon. The only thing that I did not like about it (not Disneyland's fault) were the rude foreigners!! If you can deal with that, you'll have the time of your life!! :)",1
26617,"Early entry to the park was great as it gave our family of four time to enjoy some of the more popular rides without the long lines. The Jungle Cruise was a family favourite but the kids, 2 & 4 actually enjoyed the Pirates ride as well as the Haunted Mansion in the afternoon. Toon Town was fun for the kids and Goofy's play area was a nice break for the kids to run around in. My 2 year old loved Its a Small World but my DH and 4 year old tolerated it for family. We didn't do the line up for Princess Fantasy Faire but the wait just couldn't be justified as we participated in the Mother's Day Brunch at the Disneyland Hotel and saw all the princesses without the line up. Ariel's Grotto for breakfast is also a good way to meet them if you don't want a line up. Don't miss Peter Pan's ride, Dumbo and Astro Blasters if you have little kids. The park got really crowded in the evening but I found out later that it was due to reduced entry prices so if you don't like the crowds, keep it early. The parade was lots of fun but if you can afford it, splurge for tickets to Fantasmic. Even my frugal DH said it was worth it. Definitely come back again soon!",1
26624,Disney to perfection. We had a VIP pass and they made it worth every penny. Service Disney style.  Love it. Again and again,1
26618,"My teenagers LOVED this park! We went first thing in the morning, left in the afternoon, then came back refreshed and stayed until it closed. Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain RR, and Buzz Lightyear were our favorite rides. A MUST go if visiting Southern California.",1
26619,"We are annual passholders and didn't realize that Disneyland was hosting Grad Nite the day of our most recent visit. 1) There was a number of loud and somewhat obnoxious teenagers. 2) Disneyland closed earlier than usual (11 p.m.) because of Grad Nite. 3) Many rides (Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain) closed 15 20 minutes BEFORE 11:00!Even though we have had the pass for several years, this is the first time we've been to Disneyland on a Grad Nite. Having experienced it, we now know to avoid it!",1
26620,"I always like Disneyland, it's a native southern California thing.  Ya know?",1
26621,Lots of fun as always and yes its crowded. A lot of renovation going on right now. Not a place to go if you are on a budget!,1
26622,"We're lucky enough to live about 3 hours away so we buy the annual passes and visit several times a year. The new Star Tours is a favorite as well as Indiana Jones, Haunted Mansion and of course Pirates. The parades are awesome as well as the characters that are roaming around. The Golden Horseshoe was a really funny show. Stay for Fantasmic and the fireworks!",1
26623,Great place. Go for a turkey leg! Totally worth it. Download the free iphone app wishing stars for some extra trivia fun.,1
26625,"Not much else can be said, but our family had a tonne of fun.  As we went in a slower time of year, the lines were never more that 30 minutes and we got in a lot of rides.",1
26632,"Liked everything  Tip: Go in Sept, Oct, early Nov, middle of Jan, May. Go on rides when parades, shows or fireworks are on.",1
26626,"Great weather, great food, great rides! I disliked all the stroller traffic! My family of three were constantly dodging some women running with her stroller. I have 6 year old and she was able to walk everywhere. I saw kids her age and older in strollers. It was nuts.",1
26627,"Always a good time! Fastpasses are a great feature. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Love the character interaction. Nice to have 2 parks so close together, and Downtown Disney, too! May is a great time to visit as it's not terribly busy.",1
26628,"Lines weren't terrible on Friday   Saturday. Sunday was a little rougher. Would recommend getting involved in Pin trading as it's fun for all ages and a great social activity to get to know cast members and other disney pin addicts alike. Can't wait to go back. Couple of quick tricks. Order pins ahead of time online at ebay (make sure its from a genuine seller) for less than $1 per pin, instead of paying $8 per pin on site. Grab fast passes early with your tickets, then walk around enjoying some smaller rides with the family and then go back for the fast pass entrance. Also, ask about single riders. I got on Indiana Jones (single rider) in less than 10 minutes. Great experience.",1
26629,"We planned our trip carefully before going to make sure we would have time to ride our favorite rides because we were only going for one day. So before going we read reviews or watched videos of all of the Disneyland rides and made a color coded list of must do rides. The list was color coded according to the colors on the Disneyland Park map that can be found online. By doing this we were able to ride every ride we wanted to ride before leaving the park and skip all the rides that didn't seem as fun to us. We truly had a blast and the rides were amazing. Our children are just big enough to be able to ride all of the rides in the main Disneyland park so it was perfect timing for a trip like this, however we also enjoyed the park when we took them as babies as well. This park has plenty for people of all ages.",1
26630,We came to the parks for 3 days and our family loved every minute of it. I especially appreciate the cast members who thanked us for coming. That made me feel welcomed and appreciated.,1
26631,"Had a ball with my kids here... I felt like a child again. The rides were great, the characters awesome and the shows were great.",1
26412,"If you have not gone to  the park  since Car Land has opened the DCA side is a must.  But be prepared, the crowds there are huge.  Sadly, it doesn't seem like it's pulled people from Disneyland, just more people.",1
26411,Disneyland is great for everyone. Can spend days there to see everything or to ride all of the rides. A little something for all ages. Sure to keep you entertained.,1
26410,"We've been driving down to California from Canada every other summer or so and have been to Disneyland on several different trips. We like to think we are now pros at visiting the park and we have a few tips to share on making the day pleasant.First off, get fastpasses whenever possible. My husband and I will split up to travel the park better and he'll go get fastpasses and we'll wait in line. Some rides are not busy early like Pirates so we'll go on those and save the new rides for waiting in line since they usually don't have a fastpass available. Sometimes we'll head to the park early, leave in the heat of the afternoon to go back to our hotel for a nap or swim, then return in the evening when it's cooler and less busy. People with really small kids, I recommend staying on site and give yourself a day off inbetween disney to chill by the pool. It's hard to watch exhausted little kids have a breakdown at the end of the day because it's too much going 7 days straight. Chill out and take your time.We have an older child so we can travel the park easily without strollers. California Park has bigger faster rides (the roller coaster is the best I've ever been on, so smooth). Everything in Disney is top notch, it is a well oiled machine. It's clean, the staff are great and we always have a blast.People complain about the food. We have found the best way to do disney is to bring our own food and water. We partially freeze water in bottles the night before and then fill and take them with us. They stay cold all day and we never have to buy water. We make sandwiches and bring veggies and fruit. This is much more satisfying to eat than greasy food onsite. We love having our own little picnic at Disney and no one has ever said anything about it. If they ask, I've been told to tell them due to dietary restrictions, you have to bring your own food. We will get treats on site like icecream in downtown disney but we refrain from spending money on trinkets that will end up in a drawer at home. We usually get one small souvenier like an ornament or a t shirt. The Aladin show is great but it's been running for many years and I'm not sure why they haven't put together a new show. That's my only complaint, to update this show. Other than that, the parades are great, world of colour is amazing and the rides are fun, charming and clean. We're so excited to go back down this summer to see the new Cars park.",1
26170,"The lines were long and the weather was hot but, hey, we were at Disneyland!  The City Pass was the best value for the money.  Be prepared to pay a lot for drinks so maybe bring a bottle of water with you.",1
26193,"I am a Disney enthusiast, and would not come to Southern California without visiting Disneyland! We had one day park hoppers and spent the first 2 3 hours at California Adventure. We had hoped to secure Fast Passes for the new Cars Land attraction Radiator Springs Racers, but when we saw that the line for Fast Passes was an hour wait, we decided that our time would be better spent elsewhere in the park. I had heard that in order to get a timely Fast Pass, you should be there when they open and go straight to the Fast Pass line, and this is true. We were not there at opening time, but an hour later.My favorite attraction is Soarin' Over California, this is not to be missed! Happily, they also have it at Epcot at Walt Disney World in Florida where we usually go for Disney vacations.We also rode Grizzly River Rapids, very fun!We spend the remainder of our day at Disneyland Park, and were pleasantly surprised that even though is was Sunday, the crowds were moderate. The longest line we ever waited in was for a Dole Whip by the Enchanted Tiki Room, which is our favorite treat there.All attractions were open, although Big Thunder Mountain suddenly shut down during our ride. We were escorted off through their tunnel system.We enjoyed a magical day together and highly recommend Disneyland!",1
26194,"We love Disneyland! It's a great place to have fun as a family. My best advice: take a mid day nap, off site. Here are some of my thoughts as you plan:  Be informed, there are many apps these days that can help choose the best days to go with the least crowded times, and the line waiting times for each ride once you are there. You can find schedules of all shows on line before you arrive. These are also at the main gate each morning. Keep one. Also get a map.  Stay in a hotel close by so you can take breaks during the lunch time rush to swim and nap! Take advantage of the early hours and the late times if you can. Bring 1 extra outfit for little ones so they can get wet in the water play areas.   The parades and light shows are spectacular. They are very loud if you are up close, but if the sounds don't scare your family, then the closer the better. Often, you can be chosen to participate if you are close enough. You need to find a good spot and sit there for 30 45 minutes before a show starts.  Stay hydrated.   Plan your budget to include a few fun snacks. Our favorite snack is the Lemonade Ice. Our favorite place to eat is in New Orleans under the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, a place called  Harbour Galley  which serves soup in bread bowls. Yum!  Try to go to both parks, Disneyland and California Adventure, but if you can only make it to one, choose Disneyland, especially with younger kids. All the traditional themes and rides you hear about are in Disneyland. But, California Adventure is not to be missed either...like Soarin, or the  Bugs Life  area, the new  Cars  area are spectacular.   You get the best bang for your buck if you go for at least 3 days. Our family only goes 1 or 2 days each visit to L.A., but we know exactly where we are going and we know we will be back to see what we have missed on our next trip.It's a bit overwhelming if you have never been and want to take advantage of the money you paid for admission. Again, my best advice, after 40  visits, is to take a break at mid day.",1
26195,"  Plan to visit Disneyland itself for two days only, each park one day is plenty. No need to buy parkhopper tickets.  Avoid weekends (annual pass holders show up by Friday afternoon, huge crowds)  Careful with January February trips   lots of storms, rain",1
26196,"We went on a Friday, Saturday, and have never seen the park this crowded. The fast passes for the car ride on the california side were gone by 9:30 am!! Very hot. Tho we Love this park. Such fun. If you can go another time of the year you would be alot better off. Even after the night fireworks show the lines were too long. Food is overpriced. 9.69$ for a hamburger! They do allow you to bring food and drinks in the park now. And the lockers are all day access. 7$ for a small locker that we could fit our backpack in. Water rides were so fun. If you don't want to get soaked wear a poncho from the dollar store or they sell them in the park for 9$. Try to get some fast passes. There is now a Mcdonalds outside of the park just a short walk 24hrs. The Park is just Great, and the employees are so nice, tho crowded it is alot of fun. Try not to go in July.",1
26197,We spent 3 days with our children aged 14 to 21 in June and we loved it. The parks are extremely well run with entertainment around every corner. The fast pass system works very well. We did have one ride break down after queuing for quite a while but we were compensated with immediate entry to any ride. This is a fun holiday for all ages.,1
26198,Disneyland is always fun but they are losing the magic a little. Lots of grumpy cast members herding you by hollering orders at you. Too many ropes and rules. annual passes just went up about $200 for premium pass holders and every other pass went up too. Still fun but you do get that it's all about the money. Cast forgets that they can make the difference in guests visits just by smiling and saying something pleasant.,1
26199,"park to visit in ornage county, has it all. try some of there Chili. Prices are getting higher, but try to get a 2 day pass or any other combo ticket. MeuterMedia",1
26200,"We just visited Disneyland on July 18th 2012. We were two adults and three kids and bought a 3 day park hopper tickets thru AAA website and got free parking which is saving of $15 a day.It cost us just over $1200!! We stayed in Quality Inn, Pioneer Blvd, Artesia, which was 15 min away and we used the carpool HOV lane from our hotel to Disneyland bypassing traffic on freeway. The hotel was $75  taxes and had free internet and a very good free breakfast with hot waffles etc. Our room had two queen beds.Here are some pointers.1. If you would like to save money go for single park tickets. If you are adults in good health only 2 days are more than enough to cover everything. If you have kids under 10 you may need 3 days to cover everything as the place is huge and involves a lot of walking. Try to be there by 8 am and stay till midnight. Sit in shows and 3D movies to rest and take a break in between.2. Download the free App from Disney which will tell you the wait times for rides, nearest attractions as per your location, height restrictions, whether the ride is open and dining options etc. This was priceless and helped us utilize our time to the max. Avoid private apps as they will ask you to upgrade and are full of ads. The Disney free app is Verizon sponsored and has the best wait time updates. Switch off phone when not in use as the battery runs out due to constant location mapping by the phone gps and there are no outlets to charge phones.3.You can carry food and drinks but not coolers. Put it in backpack and if you have a stroller can put in stroller and park at many stroller parking areas and go around without carrying any weight. There are drinking water fountains everywhere but not in plain sights as they want you to buy their overpriced drinks.4. If you have older kids or adults then adventure park has more interest to them. It also has many rides for kids without height restrictions but the old Disneyland Park has more to offer kids. You have a train service linking different areas in Disneyland park so travel is easier in Disneyland park rather than adventure park.5.If you want to ride the latest Cars ride at Radiator Springs go at park opening and get a fastpass by standing in line at 8 am or try going in as a single rider. On the days we were there the regular line was 180 minutes wait!! Single riders wait was 45 minutes. The ride closed without notice for technical difficulties and people who waited 2 hrs   in line were sent back without any fastpass or line benefit. Disney sucks that way as its too big and no one seems to have any authority to take decisions in such a case!!6. Food is way overpriced and below average. Have a large breakfast outside and plan on a good dinner after you leave the park. Parking allows in and out privilege so go out for lunch if you feel like walking back to parking lot. Even with trams its a lot of walking.7. Fast passes work after the designated time and you can get a fastpass once every 2 hours so plan your passes right by using the Disney app. Everyone needs to be inside the park to get the fastpass so your family cant wait in hotel while you take the pass.8.If your ride closes while you are in line insist on a fastpass slip or some sort of paper allowing you to come back later without having to wait in line again. If you are refused entry due to one of the kids being shorter than what is required they give a fastpass for two adults. Ask and get this so you can skip the line later.9 Nights at Disneyland parks became very very crowded with hardly any place to walk at New Orleans square area as it is a good location to watch the fantasmic water light fireworks show. You can also watch the main fireworks from the parking structure if you are heading back a little early to avoid the exodus after the fireworks is over.Overall had a great time but exhausted trying to catchup as many things as possible in three days! Wish it was cheaper and the quality of food was better and the lines for rides were shorter. The Disneyland staff from greeters to sweepers were very friendly and gave us good directions and pointers to attractions etc. Will go back as soon as I can spare the time and money!!!",1
26201,"What's not to love about the park itself.  The worst part was the hot California sun beating down on you which Disneyland has no control over obviously.  Usually we visit in February or November, I am going to stick to that plan.",1
26202,Disney is and will aways be best in theme parks. They now how to do it and they do it well. I visited in early July with my family and everything was great. the fastpass is a very good idea. It makes you able to plan the day in a very good way.,1
26205,"My husband and I took 4 grown up kids (all in their 20s) to Disneyland for the first time and had an amazing time. It's safe, lively and very entertaining.",1
26206,"we had a fantastic time , the lines were long but that is to be expected at disneyland .the rides were great and ithe light light show has to been seen to be believed",1
26207,The new Carsland was the highlight of this trip!  It's a must see for any Disney fan!  Be sure to plan to arrive early as this area of the park is very busy right now.,1
26208,"Well, Disney is Disney, but this park is so much smaller than I remembered it being. I don't really think it was worth the price of admission. So small compared to Disney World.",1
26209,The Lincoln show always makes me misty and there is so much truth in the statement that America will fall due to internal strife and corruption.  Rest of the part was fantistic but crowded...difficult with a wheel chair or stroller.,1
26192,"This park was bigger than we imagined, we have done Florida,Hong Kong and Paris.Even though it was a Saturday in July when we went we arrived at 9am and got on a few rides with no queues at all. A wonderful Disney experience.Lots of places to eat and plenty of places to get drinks and ice creams.",1
26191,First time traveller to disneyland and it well past my expectations.  The park is very intimidating in size and amount of stuff to do but the the  cast  were all very helpful.,1
26190,"I think Disneyland is one of those places everyone should get to visit at least once in their life. It makes for a fun day and does have that magical vibe. This was my second visit, with my first visit being a decade earlier. The one thing I found dissappointing was that there were wasn't much in the way of improvements made during this time. On this trip to the USA from Australia, I also visited Disneyworld in Orlando and I would rate this a lot higher. So if you are trying to decide between Disneyland and Disneyworld, my recommendation would be Disneyworld. Still I did like going on my favorite ride at Disneyland again, which is the Indiana Jones ride.",1
26178,"I have been to Disneyland about 7 times .Every time I walk through the gates I am taken back to my childhood (which isn't such a bad thing right) I love it there as a kid growing up in Australia it was always my dream to go to Disneyland, This year I had the pleasure in taking my daughter and granddaughter there we enjoyed every bit of it, and seeing it through my granddaughters eyes was truly magical..",1
26172,"You have to visit Cars Land, but be sure to set aside lots of time as it is extremely crowded. The wait time is lengthy. Arrive early if you do not like waiting a long time...",1
26173,"We took our entire family to Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. It was the first time visit for our 4 year old granddaughter. She was in heaven when we took her to the Princess Fantasy Faire. She picked out a Cinderella gown, had her face painted with a  princess mask , had a meet and greet with three of Disney's Princesses, and attended the Royal Coronation. She danced on the ballroom floor and was beaming from ear to ear the entire time. It had been a few years since we had been so we were pleasantly surprised at the positive changes in the park. Disneyland has become a real champion for recycling. All over the park recycle bins were everywhere. It was really nice. The only down side is the price of the tickets.",1
26174,California Adventure was very crowded and Disneyland was not.  Did not have long lines in the AM.  Everyone seemed to be going to Carsland.,1
26175,"This is my first time to America, my wife and I, thought that we might be too old for Disneyland, that it was more for families, with children, but we were wrong. Right from the moment we entered the park, we were made welcome from the staff member, in the ticket booth, our lady was so helpful, she gave us badges saying  First Time Visitor , which alerted staff and other visitors, who helped us with all enquiries, all day. I think all employees in the hospitality industry, should be trained the Disney way, they are the best.We had a fun day, from jungle cruise to the thrill rides, we did it all, almost. There were plenty of places to eat, at reasonable prices, the parade was entertaining and the park was very clean, it was a fun day.",1
26176,"Even though it was mid summer, lines were not that long; kids enjoyed the both parks. would be great if there more areas of shade to sit under.",1
26177,"Its been six years since we were at Disneyland and its still wonderful. One of our favorites is the Jungle boat cruise, bad jokes and all.  Soaring is the best!",1
26179,"I could return to Disneyland over and over again. This is just the best theme park ever. I think I even loved it more than my kids. Make sure you spend at least 2   3 days here, and include California World as well. Our family spent a week in Anaheim to make sure we weren't rushed. Try Millie's restaurant whilst you're there.",1
26188,"Of course even as an adult I had a fantastic time here, and the 3 days were well worth it. Although if you aren't going with children, 2 days would be enough. Favourite ride would have to be tower of terror in California Adventure!",1
26181,"Disneyland is one of my very favorite vacation spots. Lot's to do there and in the surrounding area. Disneyland is not a one day experience for most vacationers, you need at least 4 days to see it all or more. If you bring your toddeler with you you will need a stroller for sure and plenty of sun screen for the summer months. plan an early day with young ones and later start with teens and pre teens. bring snacks not meals into the park for small hungry mouths and plan on leaving the park to have dinner ( it's very costly to eat your meals inside disneyland) kids prefer fast food anyway. bring plenty of bottled water sodas are ridiculous to purchase there $3.50 a pop. you can get free cold water at any of the snack bars. Make good us of the fast pass for those long lines on the best rides. secert to some of them, ride them during a parade or during a show like fantasmic or the world of color. ride lines are shortest then. always buy a multi park pass (park hopper) you get the most value from this..",1
26182,"As a SoCal resident, I have been visiting Disneyland my entire life. As a child it was a place of magic, as a teenager it was a right of passage to go with friends instead of my parents. Now, as an adult, it is still always a pleasure and source of great excitement to spend a day in a place full of fairy tales. The park staff are polite and helpful, and the attention to detail is astounding. it is somewhere to relax and let your inner child out.I recommend attending anytime except summer and weekends major holidays. Tourists flock to Disneyland in droves for good reason, but it makes the experience less exciting and the entrance fee feel steeper. If at all possible, Tuesdays through Thursdays are the best days to attend any time of year; as it is close to the beach, it is smart to layer clothing in order to make the trip as comfortable as possible since the days can get warm and the evenings cool and damp. There are water fountains throughout the park so bringing refillable bottles is always wise. Food is generally good with several truly delicious restaurants. If possible, a sack lunch is a good way to make sure that you stay within budget with small protein rich snacks throughout the day. Many tourists forget sunscreen and spend the remainder of their trip nursing sunburns so hats and sunscreen are smart. For families, color coordinated outfits help keep track of little ones in crowds.",1
26184,The ORIGINAL Disney.   This Disney is smaller but very magical.  Cars Land is very busy but worth battling through the crowds to see.  Looking forward to my next visit.,1
26185,"Really expensive but worth it, excellent firework, parade, show and rides ?... Loved the Indiana Jones, pirates and gold mine rollercoster",1
26186,Have not been to California for 19 years and how things have changed. If you are used to Florida then these parks are small by comparison although California Adventure has a large park feel. Early seems lighter than later in the day. Cars World is superb as I'd the Califoria Screaming coaster. Great day out ax always well done Disney!,1
26187,Disney never disappoints.  They have the magic recipe down for folks to enjoy their time here.  Definitely worth the trip.,1
26210,"We have visited Disneyland for every year for the past 4 years since our son was 1. We went to both the Halloween party and the Christmas party, both excellent and worth going. The Halloween was actually my favorite and so much to do that is different then normal park hours. We danced with goofy, went trick or treating and the fireworks display is amazing! ",1
26211,too much walking & waiting in lines and very expensive bottled water and actually the food too for what you got,1
26212,"Fast Pass is easy and makes lines problem free. Ask someone to explain how this works. Also, members of your family can go as single riders and reduce wait time for popular rides to 5 10 minutes.",1
26240,"Just returned from a week with the mouse, they never cease to amaze me. This was our first trip in the summer, we usually travel in January to avoid the crowds so we were actually a little apprehensive about how bad the lines would be. Cars Land had just opened so it was really the only area of either park that was jammed with people. We did have some waits for other rides that were around 60 minutes or so but the lines always felt like they were moving.After stopping at a couple of six flags parks on our way down to Disneyland it became even more apparent why Disney is the amusement park king   everything is so much cleaner and a whole lot more organized.",1
26234,Have travelled to Disneyland a number of times before but never during the US summer holiday season.  Defer your travel to Autumn or Spring.  The queues are long and it is very hot.,1
26235,I have been going to Disneyland since I was a kid using the famous E ticket they have made such wonderful attractions over the years but the only thing that has remaid is the food. The have increased the addmission over the years so why not improve on the food it is not like they cant afford it. Now I not saying that all of the food is bad but the hamburgers can stand improvment and why did they take away the stand that sold Mc Donalds fries? Come on disney step it up now the price of addmission is almost $100 how can any family take there children to the magical wonders that every child has and dreams about.,1
26236,Definately the happiest place in the world.  The food was surprisingly wonderful.,1
26237,"I expected my visit to Disneyland to be tiring and full of line ups. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the park is run. If you plan out your day using the fast pass system, there is not need for absurd line ups. The park is clean and employees are exceptionally friendly and helpful. ",1
26238,I love this place so much more then the average person. This is the only place I know that really knows how to make you smile from the inside out.,1
26239,Try to find discount tickets before you go to the park even if you just buy them on the Disney web site.  They will be cheaper and you won't have to stand in line.,1
26243,Sure there are crowds but you just got to be smarter than most of the other visitors. Choose fast passes carefully. Base them on which ride means the most to your family or which rides have the longest standby times. We downloaded the Disney App and was able to get current wait times on rides but the App did drain our cellphone quickly.,1
26231,Some of the queue rides were very long. Some of the food establishments do not have enough seats for patrons. Since it's summer it is extremely crowded.,1
26245,"Well organised, clean, get a fast pass to avoid the long lines.",1
26246,"Who doesn't love Disneyland? I have been too many times to count since I grew up in CA. I had the wonderful experience of being able to take my 2 teenage daughters who are growing up in TN.We had the best time and enjoyed it immensely! As expensive as it is to get in, it is one of the few places that is worth it! We prefer it over DisneyWorld because you can do everything in one day.",1
26247,"I have been to Disneyland at all times of the year, and Autumn is by far my favorite. The weather is beautiful and the crowds are at a minimum. We have found that the first two weeks of September are the least crowded. Once the Halloween decor comes out (check Disney's website for dates) so do more people. But even with the increase in traffic, we waited in line an average of only 5 to 10 minutes longer per ride than we did on previous trips taken earlier in September. I have also heard that the first week of November is good because the Halloween stuff is still out but the crowds have again decreased. it should be said, though, that more rides are closed for refurbishment at this time, and there are fewer shows and fireworks, check the Disney website will tell you what ones. We have stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and, most recently, the Fairfeild Inn by Mariott. The Fairfeild Inn was great for several reasons. It was nice and clean, and the bed was super comfy( no kidding, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on.) It wasn't spectacular, but nice. It was about a 7 minute walk, if that, from the main door of the hotel to the main enterence of Disneyland and California Adventure. And the fact that it is about $1,000 cheaper than staying at the Disneyland Hotel makes it a good choice. But if money were not an issue, I would definitely stay at the Disneyland Hotel. It's fun to never leave the Disney magic. Is it worth the money? I'm saving up so we can stay there again on out next visit. As far as eating goes, we saved a ton of money by eating breakfast in our room, packing snacks and pb&j for lunch, and eating dinner in the park. We love Goofy's Kitchen, which is located at the Disneyland Hotel. The food is good, and my three kids told a neighbor that this was their favorite part of the vacation. You have to make reservations in advance. we have eaten there for breakfast and dinner, both are great but I think you get more for your money by doing dinner. Prime rib will win over waffles every time, in my book, and the prices are the same. On the night we ate dinner there, the monorail was not running, we we had to walk to the restaraunt. We walked fast and made it there in about 10 or so minutes. You do need to make a reservation, and plan on about 2 hours to eat. When we left we were so full we could hardly walk, let alone ride rides, so we spend the evening watching the parade and shopping for souveniers. A note about the World of Color show at Disney California Adventure  don't miss it! My husband admitted that he was not really looking forward to this, but it turned out to be one of his favorite parts of the trip. When we were there in 2012 we needed a Fast Pass, which are handed out inside the park. We went right to the fast pass booth first thing in the AM, and they literally handed us the last passes. Remember that the park opens early on days starting with the letters T and S, so if you can plan to take advantage of an extra hour in the park on these days.To help us book our vacations we used a travel agency called Get Away Today. They are friendly, know their stuff, and saved us money. I recommend them highly. I hope you have as much fun on your Autumn trip to Disneyland as we did.",1
26248,"I've never had a big desire to visit Disneyland or Disney World. I have to say that I would definitely go back, because we had a blast. We did Disneyland Park & Disney California Adventure Park in one day! (7 am 10 pm). We only had a few days in Anaheim & I didn't want to spend every day in a theme park. The secret for us was using Ridemax (Google it). If you follow their tips & experiment with various itineraries you can save yourself time and money. We visited in peak season (late June) and never waited more than 15 minutes to get on any ride. I highly recommend the Aladdin show, the parades, the World of Color show at the end of the night. Our favorite rides were California Soarin', California Screamin', Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Tower of Terror and Indiana Jones. Because we had lots of time left over (thanks Ridemax!)   we went on other rides such as Finding Nemo, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder, Haunted House etc. They were all enjoyable. TIP: save yourself some time by ordering box lunches online & get a Fastpass for World of Color at the same time. Hey, you have to eat lunch anyway & the box lunches were good and came with a souvenir bag. You can pick them up anytime after 11:30 a.m.",1
26249,"A great place but quite crowded. Expect significant waiting time at the most popular rides. Longest wait for the Splash Montain, so head there immedialtely after opening for minimum que. Great thrill : ). We also liked Big Thunder Mountain Railroad (roller coaster) and the Haunted Mansion. Matterhorn Bobsleds was a big disappointment.",1
26250,"Overall, it was better than I expected. The rides were longer than I thought they would be, and they were also very neat and well put together. We also met the princesses and other characters. It was nice that the princesses took the time to talk with my daughter and take a bunch of pictures. We also saw the princess show and it was fun because my daughter got to participate. I highly recommend going through Mickey's house, I thought it was amazing and I am 27 years old! We also enjoyed the Pirates Island and Frontierland. I was kind of disappointed in Tomorrowland, but the submarine ride was really neat. The only bad thing about Disneyland was the lines, I guess it is to be expected.. but it still sucked.",1
26233,"Wow, July is busy. Map out what you want to do ahead of time and what you want to get fastpasses for. Remember, you can use the fastpass after the time, but not before. You will not see it all in 2 days. Stay more if you can.",1
26230,"You know the deal at Disneyland.  Its a great experience.  Saturdays are good right now since most premium pass holders are no longer renewing at that rate,so the park is very accessible on a Saturday.",1
26213,We had fun at this park and the other one. We bought a 1 day hopper pass. We were told by AAA that we could get a discount at the gate but we didn't get one. Keep that in mind if you have AAA. I would suggest getting a 2 day hopper pass if you have time to go. We didn't have time. Probably the only negative thing I have to say about this park is that we asked 4 different workers how to get to space mountain and only one sent us in the right direction. I wish someone would have been able to walk us over to the ride. It was dark because they were doing the fireworks so someone should have walked us in the right direction. I'm glad we found it.  It is crowded but I feel that Disney does a good job with how they organize the lines for the rides. We didn't use a fast pass and only really needed for 1 ride. We really enjoyed Space Mountain and the teacup ride and the Autopia ride. This is a clean park.,1
26221,No place like it :)) make sure your in front of  its a small world ride   at 9:30 . I saw the park and the show that they put on with fireworks for the really first time. It's stupendous. I actually cried a little  and I grew up in Anaheim. I guess I never really felt the impact of it before.:))))),1
26214,We stayed for 4 days and found there was a ton to do at the two parks.,1
26215,"Our first trip with 2 children! Ages 4 and 1!! In the past we've gone to DL DCA in early May, however we delayed for our son's 1st b day and went during Memorial Week. Although still a wonderful experience, was far more crowded than we've been used to. I think next year we will bump the trip a couple weeks earlier. Stayed for 5 days which was lovely. Dined for the first time at the Blue Bayou (waterside) the food and service were incredible! Character lunch at Ariel's Grotto  wonderful character experience for our 4yr. old daughter, but the food wasn't worth the price. Minnie's Breakfast was terrific  worth every penny (reasonable) and the buffet style was a relaxed and casual atmosphere for character dining. Big Thunder Ranch BBQ was delicious and a fun experience.All in all a beyond memorable trip! Can't wait to go back!",1
26216,"Really, really fun.  Tower of Terror is awesome!! And the new fast pass system really helps get you through the park.If you have a smart phone there is a Disney Magic app that will give you all the wait times!",1
26217,"i liked everithing.disneyland is just fantastic.and california adventure too,",1
26219,"Purchased tickets online to save queuing when we arrived. Went on a Thursday to avoid weekend scrum but it was still very busy due to school hols.Easy to find but drive took 1 1 2hrs from Andaz hotel on Sunset Boulevard 101 then onto I 5Well organised parking, long walk plus elevators to transport to park, well set up for strollers wheelchair users.If you don't like roller coasters head for Pirates of the Caribbean ride, 2 small drops then amazing animatronics and effects, It's a Small World immediately after the Main street parade as there was no wait then, Buzz light years astroblasters fun shooting, Dumbo and teacups in Fantasyland. I hate rides and was surprised how many I could go on which turned a must do day for my teen daughter into a fab day for all.Be prepared to walk around about 5 miles during the day so wear comfy shoes.To see the Fantasmic show and the fireworks get a place near the Haunted Mansion but not too near the lake as you need to scoot over to main street in front of the Disney castle to get the best views of the fireworks, they tell you to stay where you are but you won't get the best views to see Tinkerbell fly unless you can see the castle.I would recommend this to anyone no matter how sceptacle, yes it's long waits for some rides but it's clean, organised and well worth doing.",1
26220,"We only stayed one day at Disneyland in June 2012. It was a nice sunny day went we went, but not real hot. Their fastpass system was a great time saver and allowed us to ride more rides as it was very busy when we went. We live near Disney World so we wanted to ride the rides that Magic Kingdom didn't have. We had a very enjoyable day.",1
26222,"We took our kids ages 2, 7 and 9 they all loved it. We also took grandparents which I highly recommend if you have kids with age gaps like ours. Be prepared to spend lots of $$$$$$. Water is 3.75. Lines are long and there are people every where. Be sure to use the fast pass early they book up fast. We waited in the new cars ride for 80 minutes.There are lockers to charge your cell phones and also plus if you bring chargers.If anything breaks you buy before leaving the park they will replace for free.Fireworks are amazing!",1
26229,We had another great time at Disneyland. Use a touring plan to maximize rides and minimize wait times. All in party had a great time and all our interactions with Disney staff were great. My son got a bloody nose and we had to sit it out outside Aladdin theatre. Staff gave us VIP seating the next show even though the bloody nose had nothing to do with them at all.,1
26223,"It is the happiest place on earth! I was very impressed by all the high tech and realistic attractions. Had a blast, so did my kids, and I felt like a kid again! Way to go Disney! :)",1
26224,It seems more crowded than Cali Adventure. And the rides are really aging. Even my favorite Matihorn and Splash Mountain are very herky jerky.,1
26225,"Disney knows how to do it right.Make sure you get there early to obtain FASTPASS for the Cars ride. Get there for 9:30AM at the latest. Can't even guarantee that will get you on the ride on the weekend.We went on every ride we wanted to in one day, for both parks, but we had no kids to drag along.Truly the happiest place on earth. I'm not kidding.Staff deserves tons of credit. We loved asking them questions. So helpful.The Fastpass system is brilliant.Thank you Disney!PS   Disneyland we could do in one day, however, the one in Florida you'll need 3 4 days, allegedly.",1
26226,"This was our 5th visit to Disneyland with our 2 boys. We always look forward to this day and it is always enjoyable. The first few times we visited we had a laid out itinery of what we wanted to see and do. This time we flew by the seat of our pants and saw everything we wanted to and rode what we wanted to. We were there for 16.5 hours, tired by the end of the day, but full of memories. We carry snacks and sweatshirts so we don't have to go back to our car and pay huge prices for three meals. We eat one meal there, but otherwise snack throughout the day. We did not experience too long of lines and everything was up and running when we were there. It is well worth the price of admission, the place is always clean. There is always a helpful person ready to answer questions too.",1
26227,"What can I say about Disneyland? Besides the ridiculous prices, they truly know how to create the most amazing family memories. The staff goes above and beyond to make your family happy and your children remember their experience. We go twice a year and I have to say that if you can visit during the winter, it is a far superior time of year   while the park closes earlier and not all of the parades take place, the crowds are much, much smaller and you don't have hour long wait times!",1
26228,"I am handicapped and they were very nice to give me timed tickets, so I did not have to stand in line at the rides. I could sit on the bench near the ride and walk up in 30 90 minutes later (same time I would have gone in if I stood in line).",1
26171,Disneyland is my family's favorite place to go. Its always clean and we go during off season so its nice without all the crowds. We try to go every other year. Im very disappointed in the increase on their annual passports! $650.00 is absolutly outrageous! We are a big family and were considering getting the passes before this increase. Unfortunatly we will not be getting them now and our trips there will not be as often. I heard they are planning to raise prices again very soon. We may not be going for a very long time. Just cant see spending that much money.,1
26169,"The  happiest place in the word  just got more expensive. $125 for 1 day pass and $269 for the  So. Cal  resident annual pass? Wow. The park is great as usually everything Disney is, but who can afford to visit anymore? Local residents should get a much bigger discount, especially in the off seasons. ",1
26406,"We had taken a yearly pass & since we are residents of anaheim too, we used to go there almost 4 5 days in a week. Yes for the whole year too.We just loved the rides & characters & the stories, the fireworks. In all everything there was just too awesome. you become a kid. ",1
26167,"I took my 4yo grandson and his 14 mo old brother along with my daughter in law to Disneyland for 3 days. We all loved it! With young children one has to strategize a bit, as the lines are long for the rides as well as the restaurants in the town of Disney. But staying at the Californian we could get in the park an hour earlier in the morning than others, definitely a plus for the more popular rides, such as cars. We also had breakfast with Micky, Goofy and Minnie. That was a huge hit and well worth the price! $100 for all of us!! My grandson loved it, and the breakfast was good. The Park does an amazing job of keeping the place clean, and the lines organized and out of site! All the good rides we WAITED 30 60 mins even with our 7 AM arrival. There is a helpful free app that we downloaded that kept us abreast of the wait times. We also realized the first night that if we wanted to eat at a half way decent restaurant for dinner we had to eat early, 5:30 or else the wait time was too long. I live near Disney World and visit it with my east coast family from time to time, Disneyland is smaller but I enjoyed the ambiance of the Anaheim park more.",1
26110,"We just discovered the petting zoo area behind Thunder Mountain. It's great for kids, and there are character encounters that don't require a 45 minute standing wait in line.",1
26113,"I was visiting the USA to go to a concert and catch up with friends and ended up with a day to spare towards the end of my trip while in LA. Disneyland time!!!I was staying on Hollywood Blvd, so my ticket included return transport from my accommodation and entry to the park   approx $120USD. I was travelling by myself, so I got lots of photos but didn't go on any rides.It is very expensive there (to be expected), but in saying that, I still happily spent a small fortune buying presents for my 2 nephews and my niece back home. They loved their presents! Food & drink is expensive   but you can take your own if you get prepared beforehand. While I had a lot of fun, the park is small and very, very crowded. Yes I was there in summer so again, that was expected. Many of my friends have said that out of all the  Disney  parks, this is the least impressive. If this is the case, the others around the world must be pretty amazing! : )Tips: * take kids! So much more fun and it gives you the perfect excuse to go on the rides.* hat and sunscreen!!! Not a lot of shady places to hide from the heat   especially when it comes to watching the afternoon (4pm) street parade.* take some water and snacks with you   food is very expensive...but what you can get there is not junk which was a nice surprise   the fresh fresh vegie sticks and dip are a bit of a winner there.",1
26114,Very crowded after 11 am or so. Waits of 1 to 3 hours in the afternoon for some attractions like the new Cars ride ( great ride).  Always felt safe for me and the family.,1
26116,"We loved taking our preschooler to Disneyland, and it was a magical trip. However, because it was summer it was of course crazy busy. Toontown is designed for preschoolers, but it was literally elbow to elbow in there. Lines for the kiddie rides were crazy long.If your preschooler gets tired from standing in hour long ride lines in the heat, here are a couple of places you can go....Try the rides in fantasyland instead. The lines weren't quite as long for the Alice in wonderland ride, the Pinocchio ride, or mr. Toad's wild ride. There is also quite a bit more shade. The village haus restaurant and the troubadour tavern have kidFriendly snacks and meals and have a place to sit down in the shade.The other fun place is tarzan's treehouse in adventureland. It is fun for little ones to explore and has some fun hands on play. However, it isn't nealy as crowded as places like Donald's or goofy's house in Toontown. Your child can explore and play without getting shoved and pushed.",1
26117,always clean and safe. So much fun no matter what your age. We love going to Disneyland. The new cars ride is worth the wait!! Make sure you do get the park hopper pass   you will want to be able to jump between parks.,1
26118,Definately use fast pass when you can.  Go early and plan your days and what rides you want to ride.  If you get magic mornings do  fantasyland then,1
26119,years and years has gone by. disneyland park is still the best for all ages. how many times we took that same ride again and again and still it amazes us.,1
26120,Disney still has it. Fun Trip.  Get the magic morning passes! It was fantastic to get in an hour early and have no lines for Tommorrow Land and Fantasyland rides.,1
26121,We just returned and had a wonderful time.  Ww were able to go on almost all the rides  USe the Fass Pass to get on the most popular.  The parade was fun and the fireworks great. My four kids loved it like always.,1
26122,"Happiest place on Earth, no need to say any more! If you have never been, you need to and if you have, you need to come again.",1
26123,"Lots of people this summer time! Get your fast pass to main attractions like star tours, too bad no fast pass distribution to finding nemo so you have to ride in late afternoon or night is better when majority of people are watching fireworks and fantasmic., you have to be smart if you want to experience all the rides",1
26124,"We loved the rides ( Cars,Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, etc.) We also really enjoyed eating at Downtown Disney and both hotels we stayed at Disney Hotel and Red Loin.",1
26125,Make sure you go early crowds start getting there after lunch park is open till midnight and have a great fire works each night,1
26126,We always like how clean the park is at all times. I would like to see more rides have Fast Pass alternative.,1
26127,Definently worth it all. We went with my nephew for two days and had a blast!! Fast pass is best!! Enough to get good value from a 3 day pass! Get in early in the morning to get ahead of the crowds which will inevitably build as the day goes on. Take something to eat as meals are generally quite pricey. You are allowed to take food and beverages as long as they are not glass!! Not quite as good as disney world for obvious reasons,1
26109,"It is Disney, what could be better? It is always fun to be here even though in August it can be very busy and warm.",1
26108,"I'm a 30 yo man and I'm still a child when I'm going to any Disney Park. I had the chance to visit Disneyland Park in sept 2010 and I really enjoyed it. Although Disneyland Park is the smallest park, this is the most magical one (dreamed and designed by Walt Disney himself). All rides are awesome, my favorites are : Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain, Matterhorn bobsleds and the unavoidable It's a small world. I've been less attrached by Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain (I prefere by far Disneyland Paris version). Shows are great : Fantasmic is a must do (unlike to Disney World you have to stay stand), the fireworks bursting behind Sleeping Beauty Castle is amazing !! For kids (and great kids like me) there's many ways to meet and greet your beloved Disney charactersSo if you're passing by Los Angeles, Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure are a must do. Kids and parents will enjoy  the happiest place on earth . 3 or 4 days are ok for enough for a family to enjoy both parks.",1
26106,Your kids will surely enjoy to meet their favourite characters. Rides are not the best on ein the world but theya ok. For sure the best thing is the setting.,1
26095,Wow! First time Disneylanders & we loved it.Tips:  Get in early. You can easily jump on 6 consecutive rides in a row without a wait if you get there early.  Map out your plan of attack prior to park opening.  Use the fast pass system & single rider system. More rides   more fun.  There is plenty of food available in the park & not all junk food & reasonably priced.  Buy a park hopper (it's worth the extra cash).  Be prepared to queue for the top attractions & fast pass them.Enjoy it   it truely is the most magical place on Earth. ,1
26088,Disney    of course it is a blast. Smaller than Disneyworld but easier to get around. Might want to eat off site though as food was not so great.,1
26090,Definitely take advantage of Fast Pass options. We got through the line for Space Mountain and Splash Mountain in less than 10 minutes with our fast pass.,1
26091,"I was there with my wife and 2 daughters (5 and 6) for a day and we had a great time. The kids loved the castle and princesses as well as many attractions. It wasn't too crowded (we were there in the last week of school in June).Having visited Disney World three times before that, I must say that they can't be compared in size and number of attractions. But they both have that  magical  mood that makes you feel young and also makes you forget a little about the stressing life we all have.I'll probably go back and try Disney Adventure park next time when the kids are older.",1
26092,"We had the best time ....We started taking our kids 2009 and 2012....We will be making it our annual trip from now on.The tickets are a lot of money, but if you wait ans go January   March you will get a better deal. Also, the lines will not be long at all... The food in the park is GREAT and the price is not bad at all.. I think Mcdonalds meals are the same price...",1
26093,"It was well worth the cost to see the look on my girl's faces when they saw the characters. We went almost a year ago and they are still talking about it. We are planning another visit soon. We had a really good time. The park was clean, the staff friendly and the crowds were pretty light. I can't think of anything we didn't like. Truly. I'm sure it can be stressful but if you plan ahead it shouldn't be!",1
26094,"We are annual pass holders and decided to squeeze in one more trip before school starts. We always arrive early to make sure we are there for the park opening. We ride all the rides in Fantasyland, then Pirates of the Carribean and a few other rides in Tomorrowland. Since we have young children, we have lunch and then leave the park. This is perfect for us because it gets way too crowded (it is peak season during the summer) and way too hot. The only down side is that Disney decided to rais the annual pass prices, some by over $120!! Overall, still a magical experince!",1
26096,Disneyland is the land of happiness. Every member of the family has an attraction to enjoy. The adults become kids for a while. My favorite attractions are: Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain. The parade is very nice. Do not miss it.,1
26105,"Enjoyed by all disneyland park is much smaller than the Disney in Florida it is just one park with alot to offer. I liked the fact we didn t need to do a lot of walking and there were always a slight breeze which i loved as the weather is very warm, this made it different from the Florida Parks",1
26097,"As an East coaster, I've been to Disneyworld 16x. I just returned from my 1st Disneyland trip. Despite the huge crowds, my family and I had a blast! Highly recommend the trip. We spent a single day in Disneyland and a single day in California Adventure. 3 of us preferred CA and 1 liked DL better. The parks were very clean. I never saw any sign of trash. In fact, I commented to my husband that the structures looked better taken care of in DL than those in DW. All of the park workers were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful. If you go to DL or CA in peak season, do some homework. The new rides in Carsland are packed. Nothing less than 90 minute lines and usually over 2 hrs. If it is important for you to ride it, get in the FP queue after the park opens. The FP line for Radiator Springs closes around 11am. Consider the single rider queue if it is moving. For both parks, utilize the FP system. It really pays off. While food is expensive (and I like the offerings in DW better), I saw loads of people bringing their own food into the park. LOADS of people. Especially bring water. The DL train system was a mess. Not enough cars and super longs waits in the sun. I was glad that I didn't have a daughter as the lines for the Princess Pavillion were scary. The shows were great though I liked that the DW venues offered seating. As for WOC, my husband and I stood in the yellow area. Not so good for viewing. My kids stood up front at the railing in the  wet zone . Had awesome views and were bone dry at the end. I hope my experience can help any of you considering the trip.",1
26098,We love Disneyland (World) and go about once a year while in FL or CA but the last two years they are getting pretty pricey. Their tixs went up about $8 per person between Spring 2011 to Summer 2012. I know it costs a ton to run an outstanding theme park but maybe they would make it up in volume.,1
26100,"Well kept park, great service, good and healthy food selections, lots of fun for kids and adults. Popular rides crowded, but that is to be expected.",1
26101,We went early in the morning and walk right in to all the rides. The only dislike is the quality of the food for price.,1
26102,"Was held at Disneyland Anaheim. It was me and my boyfriend. We had a 1 day hopper, that was all the time we had, but I think it was enough to get at taste of the parks. Ofc we could have used more yime, but we left after a looong day feeling we had seen and tried what we had wanted. Use the fast track system, its genius and lets you  stand in line  for two attractions at a time. If its your first time, your celebrating sonething or its your b day, pop by cityhall and get a badge stating your special thing. I had my b day in DIsneyland and the cast wished me a happy b day all day. I turned 30 but it was still a lot of fun, imagine how kids will like it. But when in Disneyland, everyones a kid again! Went to California too, both park rocks and have loads of stuff for all ages",1
26103,"This was my 3rd trip to Disneyland Resort and I enjoyed it just as much as the first two. Disneyland is nearly always going to be crowded so arrive early (before the gates open) and ride the more popular rides first; this may mean criss crossing the park for the first couple of hours but it will save lengthy time standing in queues later in the day. Allow 3 days to comfortably see both parks and stay close to the parks so you can return to your hotel for a break in the afternoon before returning for the evening fireworks and shows. All the rides, parades, shows, fireworks, character meetings and entertainment is included in the entry price so it really is good value for money. Disneyland is an awesome place with so much to see and do,it is worth spending some time doing some research on the internet before leaving home especially if you have to travel half way around the world to see it!! World of Color & Fantasmic are a must see.",1
26128,"We live in the area, so we visit Disneyland once in the holiday season, and possibly once during summer months. (I prefer holiday time with decorations and the weather is cooler). This park is more than 50 years old, and they have kept it very nice, landscaped beautifully, and the rides are classic fun, as well as newer modern rides. There is rarely any litter seen strewn on the ground, as maintenance are very quick at keeping this park clean. Be sure to KEEP YOUR ADMISSION TICKET after you enter the park as it will be needed if you use FAST TRAK for the crowded rides. Most parents know this, but if you have little kids with you bring a backpack, and snacks. Snack carts are expensive and can be a long wait just for a bottle of water. Also, there are few drinking fountains around, although I am sure they are there but hidden well. ",1
26129,"What can I say, it's Disneyland. We had a great time with two parents and two teens. If you can get in on the early park hour in the morning you can walk on all of the rides! Doing this, we rode all of the most popular rides in two hours and didn't have to run or fight crowds. Disneyland is still as awesome as ever even though this was our first trip back in fifteen years. We have been to Disney World a number of times between our Disneyland trips and though Disneyland is smaller it is easier to get around. This is a must stop if you are visiting southern California.",1
26130,We spent the entire day at Disneyland and had a great time. We used the Fast Pass system and for us worked extremly well. We had all of the rides we wanted to enjoy done by lunch time. We spent no more than 10 15 min in any line throughout the day. We even left the park for 5 hours to take a break and get re freshed and that helped being at the Park until midnight. ,1
26159,"We have an adult child with a disability. We get a wheelchair access pass for her because she needs help going up and down stairs and standing for long periods of time. We have never had a problem using this pass but we were unable to use the pass for viewing Fantasmic because she doesn't actually have a  wheelchair.  I'm sure I could have fought for it but then we would have missed the show! As a result, she had to stand during the entire show and got tired. Overall we had a great time.",1

26154,The only annoying thing at Disneyland Park is the waiting times to get on rides  see characters. A good tip is to get to the park when it opens.,1
26155,"Our family loved our Disneyland experience, one thing is we did go mid October during the week. This factor alone meant my enjoyment level went way up as lines were at a minimum and once we got used to the Fast Pass system we could walk right up and get on rides and all rides except Pirates of the Caribbean were operational. We did a lot of research on the best time to go, way to move about the park and how to maximize your Fast Passes and early morning entries, the research contributed greatly to our families increased enjoyment while in the park.",1
26156,"We just took our 11 year old granddaughters to Disneyland. Our last visit was 32 years ago when their Dads were kids. The park has not lost its magic or its ability to transport you to another place. The girls had never been, so it was wonderful to experience it through them. Space Mountain was their favorite ride, and it had been their fathers' favorite ride! I just can't say anything unfavorable about Disneyland. It is wonderful. There are huge amounts of people, so it is best to get an early start. They open at 8am. Also, familiarize yourself with the fast pass system for the big rides. Our girls figured it out immediately. They did have one bad experience on the Indiana Jones ride where people from the stand by line cut in front of them in the fast pass line.The day we went was not too hot but it can get very hot there, so be sure to wear sunscreen, light clothes and a hat and stay hydrated.",1
26157,"Been coming here since I was born. I can't say enough. I have loved climbing on rocks on Tom Sawyers Island, to traveling through space on space mountain, trick or treated all dressed up, cookie decorated at christmas. Always something fun to do. The cast does an excellent job constantly redecorating the park for each season. A lot of people think it is expensive, but in this instance you get what you pay for. Worth every penny.",1
26158,ALthough mainly for younger kids and those young at heart like the 4 men in their 20s I spotted in the cup and saucers!,1
26160,We flew from Australia. I had been previously twice before in my lifetime but not with my daughters. It always improves. My teenage daughters were at the Park at 6.45 am and did not leave until 6.00 pm (but only to come back to hotel to shower and have a short rest) and were back by 8.00 pm for dinner and more fun. This happened for 4 days in total. The Disneyland staff in all the shops were magnificant and certainly selected to their character roles. California Park was great but wow the line to get a Fast Pass Ticket to the Cars Ride is amazing. Recommend you line up outside the main Park entrance at 6.30 am   6.45 am   no later. When you get through the Park entrance do the fastest quick walk you can do as there is fierce competition to to into the line or you will miss out after waiting 2 hours. I must say the Car Ride was enjoyable but there are other better rides in my opinion   its only because it is new. Thank you Disneyland for a wonderful holiday (and so clean) ,1
26150,"I love Disneyland!!! Its like getting fairy dust sprinkled on me everytime I go. I just took my goddaughter to her first time at Disneyland, she had such a great time and wanted to get on each ride over and over again hahaha luckily she is great and would follow me to another ride. Now ill be back in August with my godson. Cant wait!",1
26161,"Even as an almost 30 year old I acted like a little child here, it truly is one of, if not, the happiest place on Earth. Very fun with lots of fun rides, I loved the teacup ride, I'd been wanting to go on it since I was little :) Make sure to stay for the fireworks at night, they are amazing!Plenty of food options even for vegetarian and health conscious which was good. We spent 15 hours here in one day!Get the fast pass to avoid long lines, free within the park.",1
26162,"Disneyland is more than 50 years old yet it's constantly refurbished, rescripted, and rebuilt to meet the tastes of visitors. Whether you like the athletic nightly battle between Peter Pan and Captain Hook, the screaming in the dark terror of Space Mountain, or the  Look Ma, no hands!  driving of Autotopia, Disney seems to have something for everyone.For this visit, I was in the park shortly after they opened (highly recommended), picked up a Fast Pass for Indiana Jones, and was on my top ride of choice, the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, within a few minutes. On my way out of Buzz, I stopped to email my Astro Blaster photo to myself   this is a Disney freebie, but it also gives them your email address.Space Mountain was closed for about two hours, but it was open before noon   it's still a thrilling scream a minute ride. Pirates of the Caribbean was fun, as well as the Haunted Mansion. After a quick beignet, it was on to a  new  ride, Indiana Jones. This ride was quite entertaining, especially when the enormous ball chased us. I climbed all over Tarzan's Tree House (approx. 11 flights of stairs), then it was on to the Enchanted Tiki Room.After some  tiger tail  breadsticks, I posed for a souvenir chalk portrait, then went back to my nearby hotel for a few hours of break time. Following some swim and sauna time, I boarded the ART bus once more and was back on the trail at Disney. Speaking of ART, thats the Anaheim Resort Transportation, providing inexpensive bus rides between Disney and many local hotels. It's $4 a day, $10 for a three day pass, per person. Ticket machines are outside many hotels along the ART route. Transfers to other ART buses are free, and the transfer station is in the Disney parking lot near the main gate.Picked up a fast pass for Space Mountain, explored the Disney Princess Fantasy Faire, then enjoyed the dizziness of Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. The Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage was next (I needed to get my head back on straight!), then I followed up with more fun dizziness at Star Tours   the adventure continues, a 3D mover and shaker.Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes was an opportunity to paddle with the real thing, with a Disney guide, of course. Next I picked up a Fast Pass for Thunder Mountain Railroad, then joined the single rider line at Splash Mountain. The regular line was approx. 60 minutes long, yet as a single rider, I was in a riding log within 15 minutes.On that note, the single rider option is a great favorite for many folks, and I used it with happy success throughout my visit. Kudos to Disney for this feature!As a roller coaster, Big Thunder offers a shorter ride than others   but what a ride it is! I particularly love it when it appears the cars will smash into a low hanging wooden beam.After dark, the laser and light show in the Rivers of America appeared to be stunning, but the huge crowds made it iimpossible for me to see and enjoy the first show, so I left that spot early and went to the Main Street USA area to catch the fireworks. I'm sure glad I did that, because Tinkerbell's aerial acrobatics were spectacular. She seemed to dance with the fireworks. Then I scoped out a better viewing spot for the second laser and light show, which was very entertaining. On a side note, if you want to see more of the aerial fighting between Pan and Hook on the pirate ship, go to the west side of the viewing area. If you want to see more of the moves by Mickey and other characters, watch the show from a more central spot, such as the bridge above Pirates of the Caribbean.Like all Disney parks, cast members are friendly, chatty, and willing to assist with requests. Disney also easily accommodates visitors with wheelchairs or strollers. Or you can put in approx. 24,000 steps by walking.",1
26163,"My husband and I went to Disneyland on our recent trip to Southern California. I have been to Disneyland numerous times, but this was my husband's first time. We got a button for him to wear that said  1st Visit  and a few Disney employees throughout the park welcomed him and wished him a happy first visit. It was very sweet! We got to the park right when it opened (8 a.m.), which I highly suggest. We went on three rides the first hour we were there with no waiting. The park was empty! Around 10:30 a.m., the park was noticeably more crowded, and by noon, it was packed! We used Fast Pass on a couple of popular rides (Big Thunder Mountain and Star Tours) and that helped us plan our day out. The employees at the park are so friendly and helpful! There always seems to be someone around too, if you have a question. If you do go to Disneyland, remember to bring your patience! There are many people and strollers and the lines can be very long. We just love Disneyland!",1
26164,Wonderful time!!!  Great vacation with family and friends!  Recommend fast passes & early entry for optimal fun!,1
26165,"Seems 'travel size' compared to WaltDisneyWorld at Orlando   but it's nice not to have to walk so far (and having California Adventure next door and walking distance is great).Matterhorn shakes the bones, Thunder Mountain seems scarier, but some of our party preferred Space Mountain. Ate at the Hungry Bear restaurant   usual Disney food but with a nice view out over the water with the paddle steamer, pirate ship and canoes (which you have to paddle yourself, with a bit of help from some Disney staff).",1
22225,"Overall, the kids had fun. Yet, several times rides seemed to break down while in line. Space Mountain (twice), Big Thunder Mountain RR, and Buzz Lightyear. Although I know it is done for safety, it seemed a liitle excessive and limited our time on rides. We were told we could come back with our Fast pass tickets the next day, but then upon return they refused to honor them since the line was a 100 minute wait.",0
22226,"We were anticipating a great day, but the queues were huge (although this was expected). We didn't take the express passes, but we managed to skip the lines on a few attractions as single riders. Compared to the Florida parks that we have visited on this holiday (Disney, Universal and Aquatica) the park looks very dated to the Florida parks. What really ticked us off was that no less that SIX attractions were closed. Yes SIX. We felt ripped off that we have paid full price for what is substantially less than a fully operational park. It's obvious that they need to update, but six attractions at the same time? Please! Beware if you are visiting soon! In comparison to other parks that we have visited the food and drinks are expensive. Overall as much as we did enjoy what we did the fact that so many attractions were closed left us more than a little underwhelmed and disappointed.",0
13973,"Wow i will never be going back and heres why ... 1. This park was a mess with no signage to help you find your way around, or to even get in the park and no one that worked there helped and those who watched us struggle made no attempt to come over to help..2. The park layout was a mess it was every man for him self once you payed for the ticket. when you walked in it was easy to get turned around and with a lack of signs it was easy to walk right by and miss the rides .. 3. The lines for the rides were long and boring .. no entertainment to help the time go by faster.. no fans in the under cover hallways which made it hot and muggy. The employes were pushy and not in character .. 4. Was there for 6 hours and only seen Genie and Alladin and Belle for characters So that was crappy for the kids who were constantly looking for every one to take pictures with them 5. We stopped for lunch and bought 2 salads and 2 bottles of water with a very very small dessert and it costed $50 Every thing cost way to much. Which is an insult after having to spend $100 per person to enter the park and $20 for parking .. 6. After the long boring wait in the line up to go on a ride .. the ride it self left you in shock . For rides built for kids .. the snow white ride started with story of snow white then jumped right in to the nasty queen trying to push here posin apple of you in the dark  scary  like woods and ends with the queen rolling a boulder down a hill at the dwarfes ..... like what the heck where is the happy ending ?? The pirates of the carribion was odd as well with 2 maybe 3 movie show displays And the rest being bunch of pirates pillageing a town shooting up and setting the town on fire there all drunk and it basically ends with tied up women lined up that theyre selling and forcing to become mail order brides ... welp dont know about you but i didnt see THAT movie ...7. The serious lack of bathrooms and bathroom stalls in the bathrooms so once again we were waiting in a line .. Final note ... this wasnt the grand disney land experiance we all long for when we see their addvertising on tv .. not even close .. it was a massive dispointment When we left we had frowns and we werent the only ones about 80% of every one on the train back to parking looked disapointed.",0
33154,lines are two long rides are to fast to end really nothing special about this park other parks are better if you can go in other parks US or else where parks are better rides are very simple and few show at the end was actually very good that made the whole experience somewhat better,0
36282,"We visited Disneyland Paris in mid July and were surprised at how quiet the park was. Having visited here many years ago and having loved it I was a little apprehensive considering recent press and reviews stating that the park is in need of refurbishment. That is indeed the case as the park is looking a bit tired and throughout the day multiple rides broke down. We were lucky that we managed to get on the majority of the rides we had planned on and they are still loads of fun. Space Mountain especially is fantastic. The food is very much overpriced and the magic of Orlando is indeed missing here but all things aside we had an enjoyable day and were able to see the funny side of the parks shortcomings. I would hesitate recommending a visit until the park is updated. Being in my 30s and going with a friend we could manage our expectations and make the most of it but I can't help but feel sorry for families having to spend a fortune to bring their kids here and being short changed due to poor maintenance, worse food, demoralised and uncaring staff and rude patrons. Poor show, Disney. Take some of the ridiculous amount of revenue generated by Frozen and spend it on giving this park a lick of paint.",0
36281,"I have been to Disneyland Paris quite a few times. The first time was in 1992 when it first opened.Back in '92 It was expensive but well organised and the staff in general were polite and helpful. They had a happy and friendly disposition which you would expect from a theme park.I am sad to say that the original park has deteriorated and in need of a make over. The restaurants and rides are generally unresourced which makes the whole experience painful.You would for example not expect there to be long queues just to get into a restaurant. We pre booked all of our restaurants but still had to queue to get in. A 1:00 pm reservation turned out to be an actual 1:35 get into the restaurant followed by slow service. This was more a staffing issue (presumably to save money)I was also disappointed by the number of rides being refurbished. When you pay   50 00 to get in to a park, you expect to see all of it, not 85%. but at least they are refurbishing the place as it does look tired. Closed rides included space mountain, the Jules Vernes experience, etc. Some rides were closed due to technical reasons including the Aerosmith ride and thunder mountain. (I thnk some serious maintenance is required)So what else can be done to improve the experience?Add a few benches for people to sit on. There are very few places to sit, especially if you are wobbly on your legs.Fit better signage. You can spend quite a while finding things. A few extra well placed signs would go a long way.(signs in English, German, Italian, Spanish etc would not go amiss)Transport.Getting from the 'charles de gaulle' airport was a nightmare. The airport is very large and poorly signed. We laned at terminal 2 and had a train journey from the terminal to our baggage carousel. A journey of 20 30 mins. None of this was explained and we found the staff ignorant and rude.The actual bus transfer from the airport to the resort was also an experience. The driver spoke no english despte the fact that all passengers were from england. I can spek some French so I could understand the instructions (to an extent). The bus assistnat made NO ATTEMPT to help passengers with there luggage. He merely watched passengers of all ages putting there own luggage on the bus. (lazy and rude)The driver yelled 'Quelle Hotel' which i could understand but many travellers could not understand his ruse questioning.The hotel staff at the Sequoia were excellent. Friendly, well spoken and very helpful.The hotel was clean and quiet.You could walk from the hotel into Disneyland (10 15 mins) or catch a shuttle bus. Again no explanation by the driver that you needed to get off at the train station and walk 500 metres into the park.FoodAs was previously, the cost of food in the park is very expensive. I would recommend buying the food vouchers before you go, but dont buy a full board option, opt for the half board. You will get too tied down watching the clock for your next meal time.A half board option lets you choose a lunch time treat (tere are lots of places to get sandwiches, burgers etc...i.e. Earl of Sandwich, McDonalds etc)The meal vouchers are poorly explained but please note that you should book your restaurants early as the restaurants get full and you may not be able to get in. Also, some restaurants are only open lunch time ot tea time (some both)Beer is not always available...we found beer available at tea time but not lunchtime in some restaurants.Restaurants were understaffed and the service slow. The odd restaurants were however excellent i.e. Walts restaurant on Main street.We booked our restaurants on the first day (of a 5 day holiday) and the best time we could get into Cafe Disney (for a character dinner) was at 10:00pm. Not good enough when you have a 1 year old and a 5 year old.Menus also need a clarification which states which level of meal voucher you are using. We had a 'plus' meal voucher which allows you to use a certain number of selected restaurants and a particular set of meals.... this is unclear and it is easy to order food that is not on your meal plan.Snack Vouchersyou also get a set of snack vouchers which we found wee useless. You can only redeem these at certain times in certain venues. WE ended up throwing ours away. They need to be available for use all day and in all venues to be of any use.SmokingSmoking is allowed in the park...Entry TimeIf you visit by car and for the day, you will only be able to get in after 10:00am. Be prepared to queue for 30mins or more to get in.For people stopping in the complex, i.e. any hotel or the camp davey crocket, then you can get in at 8:00 but note that not all rides are open at 8:00 so it is a little bit misleading.Also, you need to access the park by the right hand queue (poorly signed) and show your disney hotel pass ID card. This gets you past the longer queues (day tripper queues)Ride Waiting TimesTimes displayed on the waiting time boards ere not particularly accurate. 10 mins could mean 20mins etc.Overall scoreI will go to Florida next time as the french resort is dated and in much need of a make over. The site is understaffed and the staff morale is generaly low. (not enough smiley faces)5 10",0
36280,"The park was enjoyable and the highlight for us was the lunchtime and early evening parades. All the people involved in these performed to a very high standard and looked as though they were enjoying what they were doing.The fireworks and show in the late evening was very clever   not my thing, but it is something I would suggest you see.There were some good rides   these included Buzz Lightyear (which we went on many times) and Pirates of the Carribean.The reason for an average is that so many of the attractions were closed   at least 8 of the ones my children wanted to go on. I fully understand the need to refurbish, but I think this was excessive, especially for the price of entry.One thing to mention is the cleanliness of the park   this could not be faulted.We have been to Alton Towers and Portaventura and I am disappointed to say that we enjoyed both of these more   the latter especially.We may go back, but we won't be rushing back.",0
15580,"Disneyland was disgusting when we were there two weeks ago Wednesday!!! They must be cutting back on help. It just isn't the same anymore. It wasn't even crowded, but my husband and I started to walk into two different restrooms and couldn't use them, we walked right out because they were so filthy!!!We rented a locker and it was filthy too!!! Also, the last 3 visits there, the ponds were so full of algae, they smelled and there were very few ducks!!! I don't blame the ducks, they didn't like that mucky water either!!! We were sitting and eating and got whiffs of the stench. It was a real turn off. They are letting things go. It is so expensive there and they have raised the price of parking, admission, the food and then so many attractions are closed!!! What a rip off!!! We aren't renewing our pass.Walt Disney would be furious!!!",0
30098,"Went here with better anticipation. Probably my own fault for coming during tue summer holidays. All my daughters wanted to do was meet a princess. Could not happen unless we stood for over an hour and half. For 3 4 yr olds that is not practical. I advise for the princess pavilion they do a tickets service like toon house in Disney Studios. Rides were very poor for the time waited, example 45 mins for peter pan and then having my 4 year old quoting that it was too short and boring, Having visited DisneyWorld Florida I will not waste my money on this establishment ever again. I would rather fly to the USA for the weekend then come back to France. Standard rude French staff but not all. Food Drinks price to be expected, people smoking everywhere and security just allowing it. This was more like two days of hell then two days of Fun. Save your money snd fly to USA.",0
30099,"We knew before attending that it may not be as great as Walt Disney World but never the less we were excited to go. The layout is similar to WDW but lacked in some rides and the overall excitement. We went later in the day and found that 3 4 hours was plenty of time for us to see it all. Surprisingly during this time we never saw a Disney character. Overall, if you go with an open mind to have fun it is worth a visit. ",0
36276,"when I say speechless I'm not sure whether I mean it in a positive or negative way!! The whole park was extremely crowded, and some people were very rude, pushing past me and my family, when there was clearly no room to pass. In the restaurant there was no where to sit and to queuing to get food took at least an hour, plus the food sizes where small and at a high price. Don't go on the peter pan ride, its a waste of time!!! On the other hand I still enjoyed going to disney land because I saw the castle and explored the wondrous park.",0
36275,Having been to Disneyland in Florida it was no doubt this park was built at half the size and half the thrill.  Good for young kids but as a true fan of Disney was left waiting for what I knew should be happening.,0
24092,"I cannot believe how much money we paid for tickets and what we were able to do in the park due to the crowds.....unbelievable! We visited the park in the early 80's when our children were young and wanted our grandchildren to experience it now. Not even close to the fun we had back then. Long, long lines for everything! And the cost for food, merchandise and even a bottle of water was ridiculous! The park is still really clean and it has lots to see and do but you are very limited to what you'll experience due to the huge amount of people wanting to experience the same thing. If you have the luxury to go during the winter on a weekday, I think you'll have better luck getting your moneys worth than we did.",0
4383,"Quite a bit smaller than the one in Florida, but still has a variety of rides (Space Mountain etc...)   Not cheap for 1 day, but if you live here the yearly passes are good value.",0
4372,This is the second Disney land I have visited after Orlando and I didn't like it again. Those parks are just overrated with too many people and little rides.For the rides you need to wait for long time and even for kids is not so much to see.Prices in the park are as usual overpriced as well. If you are in HK just a short time go to Ocean park which is a bit better. ,0
36271,"Being that I am an Annual Passholder and live in Florida my review may be a bit biased and harsh. Disneyland Paris was what I was most looking forward to for my European vacation and boy was I let down.First of all, the  Disney Standard  is not evident at this park. There is garbage, they are understaffed, the staff is not up to Orlando Cast Member standards, the rides are old, and the over all park is in need of a major facelift.I was so disappointed in the overall energy and atmosphere of this park. The Disney magic is not here. I am glad that I went and I was able to cross this off my bucket list, but I can honestly say that I probably will not attend Disneyland Paris again.The food selection was also a let down. We went to Casey's Corner which was a catastrophe. It was dirty, the cast members were slow and talking and in no rush to get people their food in a timely manner.The Downtown Disney section of Disneyland Paris was hardly a downtown Disney area. I will say that there are some special rides that Disneyland Paris. The Crush roller coaster was amazing and the few rides were very cool. They also don't have Photopass photographers which was odd to me.Overall I was so disappointed. I was hoping my boyfriend was going to propose while we were there but I was actually relieved when he didn't. It was not the romantic Disney magic I was hoping for.",0
4373,"Disneyland HK is awesome, very clean and neat. Liked the fact that some of the rides were update to modern world. Like small world u notice that the toys are new and cant notice some of the joints. Its a bet of small park so one whole day is good but avoid weekends and holidays it gets really busy. What i didn't like about it were two things. Quality of food was ok, i remember in orlando and paris food was so good but in this park food was average, except for deserts they were very good. Maybe thats to keep cost down but would consider having 1 or 2 resturant with higher quality food (could be burger and pasta better than what they got right now). The biggest thing that upseted me was taking picture with characters. We walked in to the park and my 1 year old saw Mickey and Donald and ran to them. But the people handling the line said they are done cause they got to get ready for the parried. It was only 12 and parried is at 3 pm. They said come back after 3:30!!! Like kids can work with appointments. How can u say no to a kid. What was more upsetting we went to a store close by came out and saw some new people in the line!!! Its like choosing, was going to make an issue on the spot but my girl wanted to play so didn't want to make her day worse. I am not sure if management will read this but they need to get their staff act together and get them educated on how to manage a kids world (not a adult world).  ",0
8919,"This was not our first trip to Hong Kong Disneyland and our main purpose was not just to visit Toyland but since it was there, we had a peek to see what the fuss was about. Compared to the  original  sections of HKD, this new section was a major disappointment. Most of the rides are designed for older kids and adults so no joy for toddlers here, unless your tots are adrenaline junkies. Don't waste your time, stick with the older parts (which we did on our 2nd day) and have a blast there (and we did)! To sum it up   if you are going to HKD just for Toyland, think twice.",0
30102,"Most of the reviews I   ve read are quite accurate and the tips are excellent.We had a great time in the 35DegC heat which was really tiring. But the bad manners and rude visitors we encountered was shocking   mostly (not all) from the French which was even more tiring.It may be a culture difference but they don   t adhere to any queuing etiquette or general manners. In a queue if you leave a small space in front of you, I guarantee someone will try and sneak in and jump the queue. They don   t let the disabled or prams onto the bus first they just barge in. Smoking is banned in the park apart from some allocated smoking areas, guess what, our French visitors just smoke wherever they want including around children   soooooo rude !! The cast members staff never tell them    no smoking    etc they just carry on regardless, which is their general attitude. Most cast members appear pretty uninterested, no Disney smiles or    have a nice day attitude   . There are some great rides attractions but some are really dated. The Disney Junior show has got three acts (Handy Manny, Little Einstein   s and Winnie the Pooh) all 3 have been discontinued for about 5 years!!Utilise your fastpass wisely as the queues are very, very long. 2 hours at The Princess Pavilion   abs outrageous.Don   t let this review put your off going as we had a fab time, but just be aware it   s not as sugar coated as you   d expect it would be.",0
6626,"I have been to Tokyo Disneyland, the experience with HK is only about 15% close.Disneyland suppose to be the happiness place on the planet, the one in HK does not really make you feel that way, I guess is the service quality they provide.@ goqlue.com",0
6625,"If you have been to other Disneyland Parks in other countries, you would be disappointed with the size and the attractions in HK Disneyland. Its a lot smaller than other Disneyland Parks (Paris, Orland, Tokyo are the ones I've seen) and the rides are quite few. We went on a Tuesday where foot traffic was quite low and got there at 10am. We rode all of the rides and visited all attractions and managed to finish everything by 5pm. Note that this includes 10 30mins wait for each ride. The parade was scheduled at 7:30pm then fireworks follows at 8pm. We didn't wait for both. We just wanted to go home since there's nothing else to see. Just to add, it also has the smallest sleeping beauty's castle that looked more like a prop that a real castle. On another note, my nieces who were Disneyland first timers loved the experience. I guess HK Disneyland works for kids and for Disney first timers.",0
15572,"We just returned from a family vacation to the Magic Kingdom and have to admit that some of the magic has disappeared!! Huge disappointment was the fact that almost every ride we went on had some type of malfunction that created delays from 5 to 20 minutes and two completely closed down for the day! We have since spoken with others who experienced the same thing   one with an evacuation from the top of California Screamin'! We also experienced extremely long lines when entering the park from the Downtown Disney side. What made it more frustrating was that there were no line control barriers until almost at the gate so there was lots of jostling for position and crowding. The entrance off Harbour Blvd., however, seemed to handle the crowds better.The parades at both California and Disneyland side and character breakfast at Goofy's Kitchen managed to convince us that there was still some magic left at Disneyland. But after more than 25 years of going to the park, it's gone from being the  happiest place on earth  to a themed amusement park. Perhaps Disney management needs to re evaluate their service delivery to minimize ride disruptions and offer better crowd control on those especially busy days like Mother's Day and the marathon runs.",0
33158,"Last month (August 2016) was my second time ever at Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney Studios Park... I grew up going to the US parks (been to WDW and DL at least 20 times in my lifetime), haven't been to any of the Disney parks located in Asia... I'm mentioning this as a reference point.Returning to Disneyland Paris was a terrible experience, it was my birthday and my girlfriend's first time ever at a Disney Park (I wanted to take her to WDW, but she's from South America and doesn't have a US visa).The two main problems that we encountered where that there are many rude cast members (I would say about 40% of the ones we interacted with) and also that rides kept breaking down.Our first ride was Buzz Lightyear's at Tomorrowland.... it got stuck for at least 2 minutes halfway thru.The same happened with Haunted Mansion later in the evening... we only rode it once, and it got stuck twice! For about 2 minutes the first time and 5 minutes the second.The Ratatouille ride was also out of service for a couple of hours right in the middle of the day... we later returned and it was working fine.Had a reservation made over a month in advance at Chez Remy, it was for dinner but since we rode the attraction at about 3PM, we asked if we could see the place and the host with a smirk replied that it was  better  to wait to see it later, at the time we had our reservation so that it was a  surprise  for us... a  polite  way of saying  no ... because of this attitude we decided to have dinner elsewhere.We were also treated rudely by another cast member at the Aerosmith ride... I don't even want to write it because it will probably take too much of my time and I don't really want to remember it.After that I simply tried to stop interacting with cast members.Guests were also smoking everywhere around the park... something you don't usually see at the US parks... EVERYWHERE.One of the few positive things I can say about this park is that the castle is perhaps the prettiest and the Ratatouille ride is very good... but not worth traveling all the way to Europe for... You'll have a much more magical, authentic Disney experience at the US parks.",0
36263,It is extremely expensive and they do kill the magic of Disney! Many Attractions had technical problems and concerning the staff one could feel that many of them are frustrated and some look like kind of pissed off! Some of them are quite unpolite!,0
15570,"Closed:Pirates, Mr Lincoln, Safari boat ride and Indiana jones.Went to the town hall to complain had to wait in line....they then told me to fill out online.Paid 2 adults 1 child almost $400. To watch obese Americans eat cakes, ice cream, etc.According to my child it was a great day. ",0
36261,"After visiting disneyworld in Florida over 25 times I have come to expect a certain standard , foolishly I expected the same standard at Disneyland Paris , how wrong was I . It was a disgrace , bad service , badly organised , dirty and no attention to detail.i won't be going back. Come on Disney get your magic back",0
22240,"Where to start... ok.. we arrived to where the Disneyland at 9 on the dot. The park opens at 9. and the parking lot for the park was closed.. not full.. just closed, so it took us 40 minutes to move up 1 block to turn around. Only to be forced to park at Downtown Disney then have to walk all the way to the park  no shuttle.. nothing. Then we had to wait in line to have a tiny purse that can only hold a camera checked for what seemed like half a day. Eventually made it in the park a bit past 11am. We go inside the park.. only to find out a bunch of the rides are closed! When we asked for directions or where the restroom was.. EVERY employee in the park had an attitude. I asked where I could find a map for the park and was told  outside . The bathrooms are so so so so old and dirty. There was zero control over the lines as well. People kept cutting the lines for EVERY ride!! It was crazy! I've been to many amusement parks and several times to Disneyworld and have NEVER had this issue! Also, there were no park photographers anywhere. At Disneyworld, they're everywhere! In Disneyland, we found 1. Ride operators.. super rude as well. The whole experience was pretty much ruined from the start. Not magical at all. I will 100% NEVER be going back again. I love Disneyworld Orlando and will be sticking to that in the future. OH.. and the food WAS. SO. NASTY. SO SO SO NASTY!!",0
31473,Do the maths complete con spend all day in a que for rides last 2 mins too busy ....upsetting for children !!,0
36360,"My wife and I visited Disneyland Paris   and we were really disappointed. When it came time for dinner, we found that many restaurants had closed or were closing. The one that was open featured underdone chicken fingers and stale fries   and all of the tables were cluttered with left over food and trays   that were never cleared during our meal. Lines for most rides were short   except for the Railroad. We waited in line for nearly an hour   they simply weren't running enough trains. Occasionally we found staff to be short and rude. There didn't seem to be any managers available or supervising operations. I would not attend again in the future. Save your money and enjoy Paris!",0
36362,"This was our fifteenth visit to Disneyland Paris and were looking forward to it as always. The main issue is that the park is undergoing lots of renovations. On one day there were only three rides open in Tomorrowland. The gardens were also a little overgrown. The water on the small world ride was not clean, paint work was peeling off and the flower beds had weeds taller than the flowers.There also seemed to be reliability issues with the rides Big Thunder Mountain a major attraction was broken more than four times a day. Crushes Coaster also had issues.We still had fun but I think they need to slow the speed of the renovations down finish one thing before starting the next or reduce the price of the tickets during this time.",0
36505,"Loved the spring parades. We had a two day, two parks pass. We visited the Disney studios on the first day and the children seem to enjoy the studios more than the park. Overall a wonderful experience for my 6 year old twins.",0
30049,We got our tickets from Australia before we left. We had trouble getting in but the customer relations team was extremely helpful in sorting it out.We got the 1 day 2 parks pass. As during the time we went the parks are open later there was more than enough time to do both parks. I felt that this original park really needs an update and that it has been let go. For very young kids it is good but that's about all. We found that the studio park was so much better. If you have not been it is a good day out but do not have overly high expectations. They really do need to upgrade the street parade. We used the metro trains to get there from the city. Very easy.,0
6642,"This park, according to people who worked there, was built with one segment of market in mind: the Mainlanders. The rides in this park, therefore, are not as exciting as the ones found in other Disneylands. The park was built so that people could merely take photos, and walk around as that was what the market research resulted. Save your money for a real one. The place is too crowded, and too uncivilized, and sanitation suffers.",0
36455,"This was our second time after visiting 3 years ago and we have to say it has gone downhill since. You can see there is a lack of investment and many areas are understaffed.Quite a few attractions were closed for maintenance completely and most of the main rides during our stay broke down at one time or another. Fast passes are limited so even after 3 full days we did not get to go on five of the main rides. Only 7 restaurants were open within both parks. Meaning the rest were busy dishing out the usual American rubbish. French hospitality is not great, and a 20 minute main signing session for the children with no modern characters included, was too short. It's like they cannot be bothered! Towards the end of our last day, We wanted ice cream. We headed into the main ice cream parlour on Main Street and was told to come back twenty minutes later as they were temporarily closing   another technical fault!! It was 3.30. P.m . We just had to laugh in the end.If you are keen to go I would recommend the explorers hotel. This has improved from before, and the smaller restaurant serves nice fish meat and vegetables dishes cooked to order for around    20. The pool is also good fun for children.",0
12382,"It isn't the happiest place on earth anymore. It's getting more and more crowded. Despite fastpass too long wait. Everyone is so stressed out there. All food, shopping is so expensive. Impossible to watch fireworks, parade. No doubt it's beautiful n magical . I wish they had a cap on number of people to keep it sane.",0
25085,"We waffled about going here. We chose Disneyland Park (instead of the California Adventure Park) because we figured it was older, so would have more things for adults to do. Boy, were we wrong...We paid $175 for two adults for one day, one park. We entered and headed for Tomorrowland. The Star Wars virtual ride was exellent (went twice, two different endings). We went on Space Mountain, also excellent. Then... there was nothing. We tried Autopia which is basically a slow motion, chained go cart experience. You can walk faster, and you don't need to steer because you're on a track. I wanted to get out and walk back to the start about 2 minutes into the ride. We took the Monorail   who ha... Took the Matterhorn bobsled style ride... it was more hype than thrill and at the end my tailbone was halfway up my back. Though, to be fair, it wasn't a bad ride, just jolty and not as thrilling as Space Mountain.The haunted house was closed. Thunder Mountain was closed. What else was left? For adults? Nothing. So we went back to Space Mountain another 8 times. Wanted to at least try to get our money's worth... is 9 Space Mountain trips and two Star Wars trips worth $175? Oh, and don't get thirsty or hungry there: water pop is $3 or more per bottle, meals start at $15 and their edibility is questionable. Coffee is $3 and tastes sorta like tea with instant coffee added. If you have kids   go for it... there are dozens of other rides but they are not for adults travelling alone. No kids? Go to Universal Studios instead   it's a bit less for a one day pass and there are enough adult oriented rides that you won't have to struggle to find something to do to get your money's worth.",0
36458,"In general, the visit was pleasant and the experience great.on the second day of our visit, our baby stroller, carrying also our coats and baby stuff, was stolen when we parked it outside the Pirates attraction. This created a great inconvenience to us. We deposited a claim, but this did not bring us our 400$ stroller. We felt very frustrated. How can visitors steel baby stroller? how come the park doesn't have any mechanism to track stolen strollers since this seems to be a known issue.",0
36459,"What a business idea! Let People pay hundreds of Euros to stand in line... even if you spend a whole day in the park you wont be able to go on all the rides, because of the ridiculusly long lines! ...and the rides aren't that many! Man attractions were closed due to maintenance.. Therese were long lines to all the food stands tio, because they didn't have enough personell. Everything lacked efficiency... ",0
22135,"I have not been to Disneyland Resort for about 3 years. It was AWFUL. Several of the adult rides were not open during the early morning hour. They closed rides regularly, and they did not have them staffed to run both sides (only half the ride would be open) so the crowds were as bad as the summer months. I am a die hard disney fan and was so disappointed. I will not return to Disneyland Resort.",0
12380,Disney used to be a great place to go visit with kids. I don't know what has changed but we were recently there and it was terribly crowded the last few years. Disney World seems to be better organized but it still crazy to spend the money you do to only get to go to a handful or less of rides per visit. I was extremely disappointed in Disney Adventure Land. There were no fast passes available after a certain point. We arrived late to the park and only got to 2 rides. Wait times were 1 2 hours. Standing around with children for that long is not easy. If you venture here be prepared for the crowds.,0
30048,"1  price is highly expensive 2  shows are limited, mostly you get in a raw for 1 hour ! to take a pic w  Mickey or peter pan or whoever !! Also u have to pay for the pic . 3 No much fun games , mostly for kids under 12 , otherwise boring . 4 The park has no much attractive places , you can walk only .If u want to have really fun ? And forget ur self w  the games and shows and pay reasonable ticket ? Go to the Europa park , even the app for it better than the Disney app hundred of time . I gave the 2nd star for the fireworks otherwise 1 star is more than enough . ",0
15640,"I was super excited to be here as it's the first ever Disneyland, but it really didn't compare to Paris'. One of my favourite rides is Space Mountain which has been meshed with Star Wars at the Cali park, and the ride was completely different! It just wasn't fun, there were no loops or sudden drops like Paris'. Another favourite is the Rock n Rollercoaster which (I think) Cali doesn't have. This place is way too expensive for what it is. ",0
36464,"The 2 stars are for the totally amazing laser show at the end of the evening (although this was marred by people pushing and standing in front (adults!) of a little girl, and we weren't even in a particularly good spot!?!?!). As for the rest... I was disappointed.. and my 4 year old granddaughter kept asking when were we going to Disney... Will not be going again..",0
8958,"X3 kids, 7,10, 12, extortionate price, very small, poor rides, ages in queues, should have gone to Jade Bhudda or Ocean world instead, biggest regret and waste, kids agreed! Chinese music, very chinese, not disney like, didnt see characters, no Disney music other than in Toy story world. ",0
36466, Please Read I would of loved to of started this review with a positive but I can not say that this was a 100% great experience. Rude Staff. (spoilt the magic. In fact there was hardly any magic at all)Extremely Expensive. (most of the clothing and gifts over    30) and as for the restaurant prices over the odds. Needs a Serious Update lacking paint and some of the rides are tired. Just looking around this park you can see it needs some serious tender loving care. Refurbishment is needed. Dust (accumulating from 1992 properly). Out of date rides and displays. And Please try to avoid the Princess Pavilion. (if you want to meet the princesses you can only meet ONE but in order to do that you need to get to the park early and book your reservation to meet them. Booked to meet the princesses at 10:30 and we could not meet them until 7:45. My partner met Cinderella and did not want to. Merida and Belle was there she was crying becouse those are her favouritesThe Staff in the princess pavilion work on a bizarre system  One Princess chosen at random for each person but your not allowed to know who you're going to meet). Once you have met them you Can NOT! Meet another one. I fought to try and get my partner to meet Merida and Belle (that was there) but the Extremely Rude staff that was very Unsympathetic would not allow thisI Told them (This is not Disney. Disney it's about making people's dreams come true not making people cry) But on a positive some of the rides were quite good and the que length. It was our first time to Disneyland after years of wanting to go BUT it was not a Good experience. What ruined it for us wereThe StaffPrincess Pavilion The Prices  buy the park ticket online the Flexi 2 park ticket   57 The Condition of the parkMost of the rides were not open. Positives...The ridesThe meal But most of all DONT go when it's raining the princesses don't come out and they don't do the fireworks. And there was no Big paradeBut I certainty hope and with your experience at disneyland is better than ours. I rate this park a 3 5 for not living up to its own expectations of creating people's dreams come true and failing to make the Magic happenI'm sure Walt Disney wanted for this.,0
15642,"Not recommended. Go to Universal Studios. The park is small and crowded no matter when you go. I went on a Tuesday in low season and it was still crowded, you have to make a line even to go to the restrooms. Way smaller than the ones in Orlando. The park is made more for locals than tourists, when in Florida is the other way around.Don  t waste your time.",0
36452,"Disneyland Paris is a classic park to go once in a lifetime. I went to Disneyland 5 or 6 times. Of course everything is wonderful, clean and nice. It is very nice for children. I think this park is not as great as its reputation. Everything is too expensive! I know that it is a beautiful and a well maintained park, but in my opinion the price do not answer the quality. Parking lot, drinks, food, souvenirs... everything is so much expensive! It's a pity with the numbers of visitors per years, the park can afford to make an effort for its many visitors. Obviously with all these people we have to wait minimum 1 or 2 hours to take a ride... I have already visited alot of theme parks in France or other border countries, like Germany with Europapark, and it was so much better, same size, more amusement rides, and the price is much more justified!!Even if it does not escape the tourists, Disneyland Paris should improve its park or revise its exorbitant prices.",0
22141,"I waited a couple weeks after returning from our California trip to let my thoughts about Disneyland sink in. We have never been to Disneyland or Disneyworld for that matter so we were novices. We only scheduled one day at the park and looking back on it i wish we had skipped it. First off let me tell all those who are worried about crowds  there is good reason to be. We went on a Monday at the end of April and i have never seen crowds like that  and don't want to again. We basically paid $300 (entrance for 3) to wait in line all day to ride four rides. I'm sorry  but that's ridiculous. Rides are fun, but the shortest queue we came across was 90 minutes. Many of the rides were closed for maintenance so maybe that put more stress on the operating rides, I   m not sure. The fast pass did help a couple of times and yes, we got right on the rides, but that whole process is ridiculous as well. This cheerful attitude that is always mentioned in these reviews was not present on the day we visited except by the parking attendant. Maybe i need a fast pass for that as well? The food and souvenirs are beyond ridiculous in price. Amusement parks are supposed to be fun. Disneyland is not.",0
30054,"This was my 8th visit over a period of 20 years due to having children Of diffent age groups (not that I needed an excuse to go there!), it my Families favorite place in th world since and this year was the 25 year anniversary of the park and we were all excited BUT I have to say it was disappointing!!!The place have not been updated for many years, yes a few rides here and there, but you can see it is old, outdated, cracking and in need of a major overhaul. All rides still on old technology, none of the modern comfort facilities, the sad issues faced 20 years ago got worse.Here is a list of some of the issues we faced that spoiled the magic.1. Many rides breakdown repeatedly throughout the day and you have to leave after being in line for 40 minutes, and you have to keep monitoring the place till they fix it , examples, Big thunder mountains, Tower of Terror, space mountain, and even some of the live shows....2. Some of the rides are really old and should be removed, like Aremegodon, it is an absolute waste of time, 3. Most of th outdoor shows is a mess, no clear sitting areas, children don   t have a good view and they have absolutely no Magic in them!!,4. There are no heat beating facilities, like cold vapor or mist that you see in other parks, and even drinking water fountain are a few with long lines 5. Buying stuff is a nightmare, There are many scattered kiosks, but whoever priced the items should be fired... items like water, coke, ice cream are priced like 3.79, 2.27, 3.34...etc, and the poor attendant does everything manually with a tiny calculator, and while he serves the customer in 20 seconds, he spends th next 3 minutes in calculation the amount and counting carnage manually, assuming he has all th change. This cause queues as long as 30minutes to buy abs ice creams 6. To be able to watching the parades or fireworks properyl, you have to sit on the floor , 1.5 to 2 hours ahead of th events with the children and when it starts, you have people jumping over you and the arguments starts, with no organizer to be seen. You would think after 25 years, the would find a better way!Every trip cost 3000 4000 pounds since we always stay a few days in th Disney hotels, by it seems we will spend this money somewhere else next year, somewhere where they care.A",0
8953,"Disneyland   a winner with the kids.   Sadly, not enough variety of rides for adults. Wish there were more things to do here!! Love the place   just not enough stuff to keep me there for an entire day.",0
4260,I visit Disney on Thursday at 10.00 am its was not crowded put most of the things was closed to 12.00 and its so smaller than the one in France ..and there wasn't international food only local food ..and fish smell all over the place. .its waste of time i don't recommend it at all. ,0
36447,"travelled with my family over the may day bank holiday weekend, half of the larger rides were closed with queue jump not working at the studio park. My nephew queued 45 mins to meet spiderman and was to told there was a technical difficulty! not sure what this implies for a guy dressed in a spiderman outfit, it really spoiled his day. Overall there were multiple instances of the staff being rude and pushy during our stay. The food is also overpriced (expected).good bitsmagical experience given scale of the park, albeit the magic wore off very fast with our second visit this weekendin summary i wouldn't go back any time soon, having been charged a full ticket price with a lot of the key attractions closed, it was a complete let down",0
36446,"Highlights of this trip have to be the Light show and the various parades. A few improvements are needed. Children aged between 3 & 10 should not be made to queue in the hot sun to see a princess. A parent told me she queued for 2 hours!! We gave up and on the second day made sure we were there early!! In such a huge park, the characters should be walking around a bit more & there could be 2  3 sites where you can meet a princess ie have your photo taken. Some of the rides were not open and a few had  technical problems  so after queuing for over an hour we couldn't use. There is little communication between both parks, so you have to keep walking back and forth   say if a ride in one park is not working and you want to use that time to queue for another ride in the other park. The attendants were not very helpful. Also, we had breakfast with Mickey   kids got to see the characters, but really disappointed with the restaurant and the staff. Thought that everybody in Disney was supposed to have a smile on their face? Do we really need to have full view of a functioning kitchen? For the price, this could be better. So all in all, kids still loved it, but a bit of updating needed to make the experience efficient and inviting for parents!",0
36445,Smoking is allowed...a big disappointment if you are not a smoker.  Classic Disneyland Park.  If you have seen other Disneyland parks in other parts of the world this one is very very similar.,0
6640,"It was the 3rd time I went to Hong Kong and visitted this attraction. Apart from its well known brand name, cannot compare to Disney World in the US or Legoland in Europe. Avoid weekends as the crowds and long tiring queues will kill you and your kids very soon. Should buy online tickets before you get here. Get an Octopus card or you will have to queue at the ticket vending machine for return tickets. Or else, should buy return tickets from the station's ticket service counter upon departure to save time. Try to avoid the heat in summer time from Jun to Oct or you will soon dry out and get tired before your kids do. Bring a baby trolley or hire one for yr toddlers or smalller kids right after entrance. Do not visit the shops first as you will go back the same way out, unless you want some burdens to carry along the visit. Stay till late for the fireworks as ot worths seeing. Disneyland should build more trees or shadows and put more benches for family to relax nearby the food courts. Should give discount for early birds. Queueing was a nightmare, but it happens in all famous attractions. Should have 2 lines for adult and kids, and kids must be given higher priority. Should invest more on attractions, as I've been here last year and tjis year almost see no change nor additional attractions.",0
22145,We have been to Disneyworld in Florida 4 times and once in Eurodisney in Paris. Disneyland California was such a disappointment in comparison. Pirates of the Carribean closed. Matterhorn broke down after a 40 minute wait just as we got into toboggan. Went Indiana Jones. After 30 minute wait the ride broke down. Went later on in the day waited 40 minutes got to the entrance ride broke down again. Areas of the park closed for beautification. But above all it lacked the magical experience we have become used to with Disney.Cast members seemed disinterested. Is it not time to replace Captain EO. Played to theatre which was a quarter full. It was so dated. Disneyland California needs major investment. Its a Small World closed. Finding Nemo closed,0
22146,"What can you say about Disneyland. For my wife and I, including parking, was $200.00 just to get in the gate. We went on 5 6 14 on a Tuesday, figuring that school was still in session so it wouldn't be crowded. Boy was I wrong, it was crowded.The following rides where closed: Indian Jones Adventure Pirates of the Caribbean Small World   my wife's favorite Finding Nemo Sub Voyage Sailing Ship ColumbiaIf there going to close rides, I wish they would publish it on their web site in a place that can be easily found.The following rides broke down while we were there. Roger Rabbits car toon spin Peter Pans Flight Haunted MansionWe where in the Haunted Mansion when it went down, just beyond where you get out of the elevator, before you get to the cars. It was crowed and hot. They kept announcing that the ride would start in a little bit. So more and more people came out of the elevator, and it got more crowded and even hotter.The bottom line was it was about an hour before they admitted it wasn't going to run, they apologized, and promised everybody some kind of Disney Bucks, that didn't happen either.We did find some rides that worked and some good places to eat, that rescued the day.I do recommend the Soft Pineapple Ice Cream at the Tiki Room, Delicious.",0
22147,"We've been to Disneyworld several times and decided to take our kids to Disneyland this year and boy was it not worth it. Many of the rides were out of commission   Small World, Pirates etc. and wait times at other rides were LONG. We also found it quite crowded. Our kids did not like it too much so that was our first and last time visiting. One positive is the ample parking in the Covered Parking Garage   a nice plus not having to go back to a scorching car at the end of the day.",0
4265,"Hong Kong Disneyland is just one time visit, it's not really big like other Theme Parks, not so impressive for adults.",0
30057,"Overall we had a pleasant day despite the 35 degree heat. I think it   s important to accept prior to arriving that you will be severely ripped off all day long, you will queue for hours and only get on a few rides and getting a signature let alone a picture with a character is like getting blood from a stone..! Maybe we weren   t prepared enough as I know that you can pre book your visits with the Characters however I don   t remember it being this difficult last time I came. The Characters now come with what felt like a full security detail who after a few minutes ushered them away so most of the time the kids are left fed up that they didn   t get the autograph. On the other hand, I must say that we found the quality of the rides much better than our UK offerings however the rides didn   t last as long. The park was clean, well laid out and the toilets weren   t too bad which was surprising considering how busy it was combined with the heat. Most of the staff we encountered were helpful and spoke good English. I wouldn   t want to put anyone off coming and I doubt I will as it   s something that   s just got to be done but just don   t expect perfect and hopefully you won   t be disappointed! ",0
36438,"Family of 4 from overseas with a 3 and 9 year old.Paris Disneyland is the 2nd of the Disneylands that we have visited and while it still has the Disney Magic, in comparison to Hong Kong it is tired and in need of some TLC. Without sounding contradictory to my previous statement I understand that areas need to be closed for upgrades and changes but it was disappointing to find so many of these areas under renovation all at the same time.The fast pass system works well and can really limited the amount of lines that you need to stand in during the day.Disneyland is great for younger kids and my 3 year old loved it. She went on everything and loved every minute we were there. My 9 year old thought it was good but he was probably pushing the top end age of kids that would enjoy most of the rides without thinking it was all a bit boring. He felt that Legoland was far better.If you could only attend 1 of the two parks I would chose Disney Studios.",0
4267,"As usual, Disneyland never fails to disappoint too much, even if it is a small scaled one like in HK. However, the crowd on the weekends are massive and it would be good to go on the weekdays instead.

22130,"We just got back from taking our family of 6, plus my parents to Disneyland. For an  off peak  time, it was so crowded! IDisney really needs to do some crowd control, but we know they are all about the money, so they won't do anything. It was just crazy. Plus there are so many rides closed for refurbishment! We did our homework before hand and knew what rides would be closed, but decided it would be worth going if it's slower. What were we thinking?! Also, so many rides broke down while we were there, in line for them the Matterhorn, thunder mountain, Indiana, and wild toad. This on top of the already closed rides made our trip ridiculous. Also, the magic morning entry was totally horrible. Thousands upon thousands of people and they only open fantasyland and tomorrow land? That hour was the worst time to be at Disneyland and so not worth it. Overall, we did the best we could with what it was and had fun, but for the thousands of dollars we spent on this vacation, I wish we would have spent our money somewhere else. Oh and I am all for letting the handicapped disabled people get on the ride without waiting, but there were many able bodied appearing people in wheelchairs... ",0
30045,"Euro Disney is great if you like this sort of thing. It   s like a tame version of Westworld without the robots, blood and sex. Great for children but if you are a conscient adult it   s probably a living hell   nightmare of a day. Lovely to see the children enjoying the magic of the Disney characters. It was really well done and you were immersed in the experience really well.I would prefer to take my kids to a real experience like a mountain side or Lakeland stream   better for the kids and me too!!! All in all I enjoyed it but for me it as a once only experience. I would not go back!!!",0

13114,"I was in one of the marching bands that performed last week during spring break. When we went behind the scenes, the cast members were very rude to us, and to be honest, treated us like garbage. After we had finished our parade, (Which we technically paid disney for us to do in the form of park tickets) we had to walk from behind space mountain to the back of toon town, all while we were burning up in our thick uniforms in the spring heat. Meanwhile, about four empty trams passed by us going the same direction. The only thing we got from being free entertainment for Disney was a super cheap generic Chinese made 3   cinch bag. Keep in mind that we paid Disney to entertain their guests, which they, in return, gave us some cheap disney branded crap and 4 miles of walking in our uniforms.",0
15652,"We have been to Disneyland 8 or more times the past 15 years and this last trip left us with no desire to return. Over 1 2 of the rides were either 'closed for refurbishing', shut down or broken. The wait times for the open rides were extremely long (even with a fast pass). Over three days we were only able to ride 9 rides due to the above mentioned conditions. Many of the operational rides appeared to be in poor condition as well; dirty, chipped paint and cracked plastic.Although we encountered some friendly cast members, many of the staff members were abrasive and it was hard to find the 'good customer service' we have become accustomed to while visiting this park. The stench (? raw sewage) coming from the castle area was overwhelming for all three days of our visit. Every morning we stood in line waiting to get into the park with smiles on our faces in anticipation of reliving past fabulous experiences in Disneyland. Our family certainly noticed the decline of Disneyland as an Adventure Park and we were very disappointed that this has happened. We have decided to spend our vacation dollars in a different place.",0

36492,We found a lack of facilities open in the park during our visit time dec 26 to 30 dec we had to go for lunch off site due to overcrowding of facilities that were open!even to get coffee had to walk miles .....to take advantage of our early entry as we stayed at a Disney hotel we had to get up at 7 am in order to take advantage of early admission to park....not ideal on a holiday it was either this or Q for 45 mins to enter park as we had too on first day!so paying high prices to stay in a Disney hotel was for little advantage in parks .....,0
4226,"We saw the local weather forecast n it says showers high probability of showers around noon n clear skies after 2pm. So when it didn't rain at noon, we decided to brave it n bought the family (2 adults n 1child below 12yrs) tickets online (you will save ard HKD350).Arrived at Disney with sunny weather n clear skies! Start of our fantastic journey!We went over to the fire brigade station to rent a stroller n was advised by the staff to ride the train before renting strollers as it only travels one way.. So we did.. Mistake.. Waited 10mins for train n took it but most of the time, the view was obstructed by the trees n we all had to stop at fantasy land.. It doesn't allow us to go all the way back to the main entrance... Really doesn't make any sense. So since we are already at fantasy land, we decided to take the rides there. Dumbo the elephant, the carousell (waited ard 20mins each which was not too bad). After which we went over to Winnie the Pooh ride to get ourselves fast pass (there are only 2rides in Disney which allows fast pass). It was 3pm n the timing on the fast pass was 5.20pm??? We decided to break for a snack at the restaurant. Food was the usual fare... Things u usually wld never eat if you have a choice.. We went to it's a small small world n there was no q!! It was quite an amazing ride inside. After that, walked back to main entrance to rent the stroller n then went on to explore Tomorrowland. By which time, the sky was all dark n it threaten to pour.. We took our chances n continued to q.. When it was our turn n we got into the cars... It started to rain!!! We continued with the drive but what made it unpleasant was the people in front of us decided to take shelter under the bridge n all of us behind were left stranded n drenched to the core.....!!!!! The rain never stopped n everything from parade to fireworks were cancelled n it was only 5pm... Not a pleasant experience though it's not the fault of the park... We may return.. ",0
15656,"The magic of Disney meets unimaginable line ups and unavailable broken rides. Grizzly River ride? ClosedIndiana Jones ride? Broken down when we arrived. Came back later when it was fixed. Wait in long line. Breaks again. Leave. Come back again when fixed. 50 minute wait, no more Fast Passes available. Radiator Springs Racer ride? 1 hr 50 minute wait   no Fast Passes available. Tower of Terror ride? 50 minute waits. Haunted Mansion? Broken closed in the morning (no reason given)Tom Sawyer Island? Closed. It goes on. Add to this the gross prices for simple food and it encourages guests to leave. For us (family of five). Flights from Canada ($$), hotel ($$), Disneyland Park Hopper Passes ($$)   all to find closed and broken rides and unreasonable prices and huge waits on site is a bit much to take. Very poor value for our family vacation. To be fair, the spirit of Disney still lives but is lost in the overall experience and inability to enjoy attractions. ",0
31486,"Totally agree with the comments above that DISNEY it,s about time, YOU stop being a rip off and cheating people. I mean even with an annual pass, the parking and everything and the wait times are RIDICULOUS.",0
25084,"We LOVED Autopia, Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean.  We enjoyed the Haunted Mansion, Big Thunder Mountain and the Jungle Cruise. We could have done without Buzz Lightyear, Star Tours and Matterhorn bobsleds.  We queued 35mins for the Finding Nemo submarine voyage to be told there were technical difficulties and the ride would be closed until further notice. We were quite disappointed. I can't imagine how those at the front of the queue who waited an hour felt like.... The ride was closed for the rest of the day.We spent most of the day queueing. Granted we did go during the winter holiday, but waiting 60 to 80mins for 2mins rides was frustrating.  Some rides were also randomly closed for a few hours and then reopened.  As a result we didn't cover the totality of the park.  I would suggest doing the rides you really like during the parade. Queues are minimal at that time.  We found it hard to circulate in the park because of an excess amount of mobility scooters. Please note that I'm NOT talking about wheelchairs or pushchairs! Obviously we do not discriminate and don't think anyone should be excluded from having fun. I won't go into the details of what we heard, but I will say that the scooters should be for those with health issues and not for pure enjoyment.The one thing that really surprised us is how tiny the castle is. We live in Paris and have been to Euro disneyland many times and the castle is huge in comparison. How funny!  Buy your tickets online and arrive EARLY.  ",0
13115,"Traveled across the country to see Disneyland but unfortunately, it wasn't ready. Several major attractions were closed for maintenance while several others shut down periodically for whatever reason. We didn't get to go on the Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Riverboat, Captain Hook's ship, and others I can't think of at the moment. The Indiana Jones ride broke down several times during our visit and we were turned away on those occasions. It took us four days to even get to see Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln as it was often closed for some reason.The crowds were unbelievable, even though this was  supposed  to be a quiet off season time at the park. They had something called Annual Passholder days and that may have contributed to the crowds. A local guest said it was as bad as any busy summer day.Overall, we didn't enjoy our visit and that's a sad commentary. If you look at my avatar you will notice it is a Disney castle. We are big Disney fans and always enjoy Disney World. We were very disappointed with our five days out at Disneyland and the California Adventure. I hate to say it, but we won't be going back there after this experience.",0
30034,"we spent there two days. the first day we went from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm, just after the characters parade. Big mistake! it was very crowded, we could go only for 5 attractions and have lunch. in 8 hours!!! the queues are huge, also for food. We also got there in one of the hottest days of these summer (the line at Peter Pan flight has no shadows (it just killed us!). The second day we went there at 4 pm. Less people after the 5:30 parade, lower temperature, more attractions. Even so, we stayed in line for the Thunder Mountain for 1 hour and they stopped it because of technical issues. luckily, later an assistant gave us fast passes fro the previous waiting.Bottom line, if you want to go there, pieces of advice:1. buy tickets online   we saved around 50 euros per day for a family of 4;2. go in the afternoon, after 4 pm Parking is cheaper, lower temperature, less people3. wait for the fireworks at 11:00 pm, it worth it;4. get accommodation at 10 15 km away in a peaceful place. like Domaine de Crecy. You will love the silence and peaceful swimming pool.",0
4219,"My daughter loves all things Minnie Mouse and she had a wonderful day! However there are a few things which really irritate mea) not being allowed to bring your own food or water under the pretence of security b) the food served in the restaurants   outrageously overpriced and horrible to eat   i had a pizza that cost $120, yet it tasted like cardboard. Disney should be ashamed of themselves for serving slop like this.",0
36501,"Having been to Disneyland in California a bunch of times, I had in mind what Disneyland Paris might have been like. I assumed there would be many similarities and also some differences, but I didn't except half a park for the same amount of money for a ticket. The lay out was pretty much the same and followed the one in California, but I was shocked at how small the park actually was. We walked the whole park from left to right with stops to check on rides in about 45 minutes. It was crazy. We had two days there and honestly we could've done it in only one full day. We went on a Friday and surprisingly it wasn't to crowded. The kid rides were obviously longer but the two we wanted to do (it's a small world and Peter Pan) were only 15 30 minute wait. The Peter Pan line was always full so if you want to go on that one then get there early and plan on waiting. The sign never said the wait was longer than 30 min so I don't know how accurate any of those wait times actually are. Phantom Manor, Indiana Jones and Big Thunder were all down while we were there. Luckily they opened back up so we could ride them. I was disappointed in the Indiana Jones ride. Theirs is a roller coaster which is fine but the safety bar was not padded and throws your head around and gave me a huge headache. Add some padding and it would be fun! Phantom Manor was one of my favorites and I think a little better than the one in California. It's a small world was way better. It was brighter and cleaner. It puts the one in California to shame. Another thing we loved was the parades. They were great! There were so many different characters than the ones we have and were fun to watch. The parades happened often which was nice if you missed a part or just wanted to watch it again. We saw the Spring Parade, a big parade (not sure the name of that one) and The Mary Poppins Show. They were great to watch and I'm not a person that likes to watch parades or shows and deal with the crowds that do but I really enjoyed them! The dancers were very talented and it was just mesmerizing to watch them dance. The costumes the guys wore was cute and the dresses the girls had were pretty. And they were just beautiful people. The staff there was happy, helpful and very welcoming. They spoke English very well and didn't act put out using it to communicate with you. I was thankful for that. The food was of course expensive. We went to the Mexican food place the first day and I wasn't happy with it. I got the nachos and the chips were some gross, generic Doritos and came with a packet of guacamole and a salsa sauce. Not what I was expecting. The next day we went to The Hakuna Matata Restaurant in Adventureland. I ordered the chicken fingers and fry meal and my sister ordered the kebab meal. The food was good but if I ever went back I would just get the fries. The fries were so good and crispy. Overall it was a check off the bucket list but if we had more people with us I don't think it would've been worth the money. Definitely go during the week and not when kids are out of school. If you have gone to Disneyland or Disneyworld in the states don't expect the same stuff. It was cool to hear the rides and characters you love speaking in French. ",0
22111,"We started our family vacation here and were so excited! The problems started almost immediately. We had bought our tickets early and were told that we had to wait in a certain line to get them. We had been in that line for more then 30 minutes when a staff member told us to go to a different window! What a way to start the day. Once we were in the park California Adventures was great! All of the rides were working but the lines were no less then 30 minutes long, hard to take when you are only 3 or 53! No one lost their enthusiasm though! The next day we went to the Magic Kingdom. The lines once again were awful and several rides were down or broke down while we were on them! I think Disneyland is tired and needs a complete overhaul! What a bummer it was.",0
36503,Extremely disappointed that Disney did not think it necessary to lower the ticket prices when the majority of the rides were closed for repairs.,0

No the money you spend it is not worth it.I been to Movie park in Germany 100000% better my girl is 4 years old she love Elsa an Frozen but she never got to see her as when the show started at 5.30 pm she was asleep.Why don't the characters go around the park during the day so the kids can hug them and take photos?everything inside is super expensive so my advice is bring your drinks and food as it is ridiculously.

15650,"The price of a Churro went from 4$ to 4.25$ as if 4 dollars was not enough.We went one day during value days, when crowds are supposed to be less.

Get there early. Oh by the way watch out for random ride closures. Splash Mtn. was closed for 2.5 hours, first thing. Now you cannot ride your favorite rides until they pack the place, not enough riders to justify firing up the ride.",0
36485,"Being avid fans of Disneyworld, etc in Florida (and yes, i know we're not reviewing those parks), we were mortified with the staff and their lack of emotion, smiles, pleasantries, whatever you want to call it. At the end of the day, these are still disney parks and i would like to think that the 'magic' happens here too! Sadly, for us, it certainly did not. The staff, apart from the odd 1 or 2, were dreadfully rude. They looked at us as if we had 2 heads when we tried to purchase order anything (and we speak English)!! It also seemed to be 'the norm' to stand in a queue, as you do, for at least 30 minutes, to go on a ride, only to have families of French people being let in  sneaking in towards the front of the queue and pushing or should i say FORCING their way in so they didn't have to wait. We noticed a lot of different people 'kicking off' because of this and getting very agitated. This kind of thing should all be monitored by park staff so that tempers do not rise. WE made our stay lovely, the park staff certainly did not, and at least we can say we've experienced it, even though we NEVER will again.The rides were ok, but again, due to lack of emotion by the staff, it all seemed to lack that 1 special thing ................ customer service. The other minor irritation i have, we are smokers and at the very start, looked on the park maps for designated areas, however, no one else did!! People strolling around smoking, sitting having a coffee and smoking, WHERE THEY WANTED TO, so, we pulled up a seat, had a coffee etc, lit a cigarette and were told by yet another miserable human being (staff) that we had to move on!!! We apologised profusely and moved and then, people sat in the exact same seats, at the exact same table, and did exactly what we were told not to do, and the member of staff stood and watched them ............. and let them carry on!!!1 thing to say Disneyland Paris. ............... train your bl@@dy staff!! Courtesy goes a long way, and good customer service brings people back. END.",0

The rides were extremely dated and each of them had wait times in excess of 40 mins even the really small rides. I couldn   t believe how few rides and things to do that there were! The facilities were quite frankly disgusting. The toilets were so filthy that I was scared to touch anything. The food and restaurants were terrible and the staff were extremely rude and ill informed. The queues at the restaurants were insane and when you finally got some food the prices were unacceptable. It cost    54 for some chips, x2 veggie chilli and x2 fanta and it was not nice food at all. I was really looking forward to the parade so after killing 5 hours it finally arrived. It was sooo disappointing. There were around 6 underwhelming floats and the characters didn   t really engage with the children at all. There was no magic to this. There were no Disney characters around the park. I only saw Captain Hook who was walking from a to b. There was no interaction again with the visitors. The only thing there was plenty of in this park were shops. It felt like all Disney cared about was making as much money as possible out of its guests. A good example of this is that after paying    99 per ticket you still have to pay    25 parking?!?! That is outrageous!!!I was expecting it to be a magical, fun place to go but it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. I would not recommend it to anyone ever. ",0

On purchasing our tickets we were advised it included a 'early bird ' admission at 7am and that was good for either the Saturday or Sunday we duly arrived at 7am the Saturday to find the parks were closed until 9am due to a marathon run. It's fair to say it was annoying to both my group and others we encountered not because of the run just the lack of communication.On entering the park at 9am I spoke to a man at the gate who said he was the Manager,I told him of my   our frustration on not being aware and his reply 'I've known for months', well your staff certainly didn't.

Although good this time, I wouldn't recommend it presently as it would seem 15% is closed due to building Star Wars area and many rides were also closed for renovation. The queues were incredible and most of our time there was spent waiting in lines. Bit frustrating when we'd saved over 2 years to get there, and trust me, it isn't cheap. We even made sure we went during the week but it doesn't make any difference. No fireworks due to wind, so we unfortunately missed that. I think my love affair with Disney may be coming to an end. : (",0

No updates or info given as to what was happening.Got to ticket office with my mobile voucher, then directed to customer services. Queued at customer services to be told I had to email then the voucher, even though they could see it on my phone. They did not have the facilities to scan it.

Other families were not so fortunate, toddlers were crying, parents were stressed and it was certainly not the happiest place on earth.When we finally got into the park, we had arranged to have breakfast there, there was no one the to ask directions.

30074,"A visit to Disney is always a pleasure. Whilst visiting Disney just for one day make use of the fastpass opportunities and first use a fastpass at Big thunder mountain.

This is the fastest way to visit the main attractions and see the parade in one day.Disappointing elements are:1) there is still no free wifi available. In all major amusement parks in Europe nowadays a standard.2) In all guides is said that the 3G 4G connections are good as well, which is also not correct! Sending pictures is often impossible.3)Dirty washrooms with noisy airdryers. Apparently this is something which is difficult to get under control for them.

The Cars Racer ride was very fun, the line was about an hour. We managed a fast pass but when we went the ride was not running. Went back an hour later and waited for approx 30 min with our fast pass! Getting that also a challenge. People go into the ride single line and get on a lot quicker! A method to the madness. Disney is usually lots of fun, yes expensive but well done.Lots of disappointments, Bugs Life replaced temporarily thank goodness for Malifecent! Not the same experience at all. Yes the stroller world is out of control, parents dragging toddlers and babies to Disney in 90 degree weather is ridiculous! There are lots of fun memories to be made in Disneyland.

Still all in all we had a great time, for anyone who has never been to any of the other Disneyland's, its still an amazing first time experience.

22175,"We have just been to Disneyland Park for the second time in two years and unfortunately I believe that this will be our last. The last day we were there, it was wall to wall people. You could not hardly even move. We had to go back to our hotel room and come back later in the evening when the crowds seemed to thin out slightly. We seemed have to hit the park both times at high season (do they ever have a low one) and waiting in line for rides that take an hour or more to get on and will sometimes have unforeseen problems arise with that ride. After all that waiting you are told to come back later. It is no wonder that you need five days to cover a majority of the rides. You can only get in so many rides a day when the average wait is 45 minutes for the ride and the ride sometimes is only about two minutes long. Fast passes do help, I will admit, but only slightly. I would like to make mention that 20 years ago when I visited the park there were far more characters walking around for people to see than on my last two visits. The only characters we mentioned to see in the whole five days we were in the park (besides the parade) were Mickey Mouse, Pluto, Goofy   a quick peak at Peter Pan Captain Hook. That is very disappointed for the kids who come to Disneyland with the expectation to see these characters   not to have to wait in line for 1 hr to see three princesses. I will also comment not so much about the cost of the meals which seemed to be quite reasonable for what you get, but of the snacks and beverages which are so overpriced. How does a family afford to even drink water at almost 4.00 a bottle. Is this really necessary to charge that amount? I will say that the service offered by the staff employed by Disney are exceptionally polite and helpful. They really do help with the overall Disney experience",0
8939,"if you've been to disneyworld in florida, then you will be in for some disappointment when you visit hk disneyland. still, if this is your first visit to any disneyland in the world, the child in you will enjoy it. this place is smaller than the one in florida so you can go over the attractions in a day. if you want to take in all the shows and go on all the rides, however, best to allot two days. its more advisable to go on a weekday as the park is less crowded and the lines for the rides shorter. some tips: wear very comfortable walking shows as going to disneyland entails a lot of walking; consult the schedule for the shows first (festival of the lion king, golden mickeys, etc) so you can plan the time you allot for rides and other attractions; fireworks at sleeping beauty's castle is 8 p.m. so go to the site around 30 minutes before the show so that you can get a good spot.the highlight of my trip was not the theme park itself but riding on the disney train which took us to the park from sunny bay mtr. the train's windows are in the shape of mickey's head, the seats are cushioned and there are glass displays of the different disney characters inside the train. your child and the child in you will enjoy a ride on the disney train.",0

15613,"On April 25th 28th 2016, my wife and I spent three days visiting the Disney Parks at Anaheim California. This was our first visit to Disneyland, we have visited the Orlando Disney Parks in three occasions.Most of our time was spent at Disneyland. We selected the time of our visit (after Easter and before Summer) on the assumption that it would be less crowded. Well, we could not have been more wrong. The crowds were enormous, and the lines and waiting times were very long, usually around 30 45 minutes. In many cases it was nearly impossible to move around the parks without bumping into people or nearly hitting some baby stroller.We used the fast passes whenever possible, but for some attractions, we had to wait in line for at least 30 minutes or more. Adding to our frustrations was that in several instances, after standing in line for 30 minutes or so, the attraction or ride suffered some sort of mechanical problem. This was exactly what happened to us on the Peter Pan ride. When we almost reached the end of the line, there was some sort of mechanical problem, and no one could tell us whether the ride could go back in operation. Because, of this, and because there was no easy exit from the line, we had to jump over barriers and ropes. This was difficult considering our ages.That sort of annoyance also happened at the Winnie the Pooh ride. A similar, and even more frustrating situation happened to us with the  Rollicking Roadsters  at the California Adventures Park. It took us three attempts to finally get on this ride which broke down twice.The Anaheim parks seem to be smaller than the Orlando ones, this perhaps adds to the crowded conditions we encountered. Also, Disneyland does not offer Meal Plans or on  line fast passes. I must also add that in all our visits to Orlando Parks we never encountered so many rides and attractions out of service or breaking down.Our recommendation is that if you want to enjoy the  Disney Magic , you should go to Orlando and during off season times. The parks are larger, they seem to be less crowded, and there are better services, more attractions, more conveniences, and lodgings options..We did little in terms of shopping at the parks or at Downtown Disney, but we were shocked by the high prices of food, drinks, souvenirs, etc. Perhaps there was a time when Disneyland was the  Happiest Place on Earth , but that seems to be long in the past.",0
22171,"Lots of rides were shut down due to renovations and the rides that were open kept closing due to technical problems. For example, I went to ride Splash Mountain and was in line 4 times before it was working long enough to get on finally. Way to many people for so many things to be going wrong. :( ",0
4299,"If you've done the real thing in Los Angeles then be prepared to be disappointed. It's just not the same. The rides are obviously tailored for local attraction and not what westerners would think are really great. Not a whole lot to do, it was very basic, and for the price we thought very let down by a Disney product. I wouldn't recommend to anyone wanting the Disney experience to go here. Food  no good, rides  no good, Disney feel  nope not at all. The locals may like it, we didn't. ",0
36393,"Stayed for the 2nd time at a Disney hotel for a night, which supposedly was earning me 2 more hours of  magic  on the second day. Huge disappointment! Only the park and not the Studios part was open, and even in the park only 7 rides...out of 46 were available, all practically in the  princess fairy tales   side, what do do with kids more than 8? Also during our whole stay some popular rides were completely closed like space mountain or Aladdin and yet there was no discount on the prices! At autopia , one lane was locked after 5 pm making the wait more than an hour long!!! Fortunately our kids were happy and enjoyed themselves making it worthwhile!",0
36394,"We came to Disney Land with high hopes and excitement after been to the one in Japan 4 months ago. However from the minute we first entered the gates we were already let down by the attention of detail compared to Japan! However we continued on with a open mind. A positive were the lines were definitely shorter than Japans as there is alot less people visiting the park. Once we had been on a couple of rides we noticed a huge difference between the parks! its actually disappointing to see that there is a massive difference, wether this is due to the park being older im assuming. The Park is well over due for a major refurb. The food definitely needs attention to as there is limited food options that are at the reasonable price. 60 euros for a steak is beyond a joke! This park is missing the Disney feel we got from Japans park. I think management needs to go check out the difference of quality between these two as we were not the only ones to say this. Two other couples we spoke to said the same thing but with Florida and California being better. Ino people made read this and think this is harsh however its reality. If this is your first disney experience you can only go upwards from here.Likes:All roller coaster ridesoption of two parkschuros stand at the entrance before entering the parkDislikes:Smoking throughout the park especially in lines, when there is dedicated smoking areas. (know one polices this!)Poor food! (Steer clear of there hot dogs) if you want a decent meal you will pay 60 euros for a steak!Fast pass booths close early.Park opening at 10am for people who are not staying in the resort. While resort guests were able to enter at 8:30am! Male staff entering female toilets to clean while females are present making them feel very un easy! More then one lady complained out loud about this! This would have to be the biggest concern we seen! ",0
22180,"Disney is a terrific place with lots to commend it. Parades, shows, people, organisation all very good. However 6 rides closed in Magical Kingdom and 2 rides in California Adventure park very disappointing. Even worse was that other rides kept breaking down. Yet the ticket prices were the same high prices. Sad to say but despite lots of things to credit the park on this is no longer value for money. Too expensive to have so many rides out of action at the same time and all the other ones including some of the newer rides (like Cars) breaking down and being closed for long periods during the day.Also a hint if you are just going for the fireworks display, then save your money, and go to an Angels game on a Saturday night. Fireworks there are spectacular and beat Disney easily. You can get outfield tickets for about $15 to $20 I think. We paid $30 for semi decent seats but we wanted to see the game too.",0
22181,"We went with the kids, if you are around, I guess you have to go to Disneyland. It is clearly not worth the money. In a private conversation I would use other words, but not in a public forum...Far too little rides, even if all of them worked   which they didn't. Substantial parts of the park closed for renovation. The rides as such are not exciting. The waiting times horrible   I guess, you could try to change something, but it would not suffice anyway. We waited 30 45 minutes for each ride, and that was on a Monday, working day.And you know what? We were there for 5 hours and did not see one single character!!! That is what is in all the advertising and what the kids would have enjoyed a lot, but we met not a single one. And that was the hugest disappointment.",0
36378,"I may have been spoilt having already been to Disneyland Florida but it was a little disappointing! I went to Florida as a young couple for all the fast rides, I went to Euro Disney as a wife and mother to a 21 month old so was looking for different things. Used the free shuttle from hotel (hipark) dropped off at the door, queues were ok and staff ok. Not very chatty or friend,y and quite a bit of confusion around all the different ticket vouchers etc. once in the parks they are beautiful really clean and eye catching. The rides for younger children were good more than I expected and the shows were great. We did the Disney junior and animagic and they were both very good for our child's age. My biggest let downs were the lack of characters to meet and lack of them in general around the park! Also the parade is only once daily at 530pm! A few other issues were the fact staff kept moving the pushchair around, there are no signed areas yet at least 5 6 times over the 3 days the pushchair had moved (causing panic and a mad hunt) if you have an old tatty one take it as they can be out of your sight for an hour at a time!!! Advice to people wanting to meet the princesses   you have to go to the princess pavilion as early as you can, you queue to get an appointment then return later that day (we had 1840hrs day 1 and 1645hrs day 2) you return and queue again,there is 2 princesses hidden inside the pavilion and you don't get told who you are going to see! You only meet 1 of the 2!!!!! Just to warn you and prepare your potentially disappointed little one! Thankfully mine was still a bit young to show any disappointment! I would not return in a hurry, we saving for Florida in a few years! ",0
36377,"Loved loved the parade   granddaughters favourite bitLoved the fireworksAll the characters are so nice to the kidsRides are good and they do keep you moving on mostHate queuing with a vengeanceFood prices exhorbitant and the same all overSat night you need to book somewhere to eat or you end up at Buzz Lightyears were food was fine but not used to eating with paper plates,plastic cutlery,garden metal chairs,picnic tables and all you can eat buffet in a dome with no windows.Still could have been worse........food could have been badThink there should be more seating areas around as the park as tiring.Seriously loved seeing my granddaughters face and would not have missed it but would not go again.",0
22182,"Many of the major attractions (Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, Indiana Jones, Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, The Little Mermaid~Ariel's Undersea Adventure, and the Grizzly River Run) were closed the week we were there and line ups to the other major attractions were long because of this. Unless we wanted to stand in line for 2 4 hrs we weren't going to meet or even see the Frozen princesses   a disappointment for my 5 yr old grand daughter. Even the character line ups were long. I don't think Walt would have approved of this type of management. I got the sense that the Disneyland Parks are catering to the California season pass holders. Those of us who book months in advance for a possible once in a lifetime trip to Disneyland expect to see the majority of major attractions. I won't go back to Disneyland Parks.",0
30075,"Lines everywhere, with minimum staff employed (except to sell stuff, such as 4euro ice cream that comes without a napkin). It's just about waiting. By mid afternoon it was hard to move around. Even with the fast pass system, you still have to wait. Waited 30 40 minutes for a ride that stopped working by the time we got to the end of the line. The staff cared very little   gave us a voucher to skip the line for the same ride, but it was not working so what's the point? Train stops at 5PM or something like that, boat as well. Glad we did not go for two days. Basically you pay about 90 Euros each to go on perhaps 4 or 5 things. And wait all day. Toilets not great or closed. When I arrived there I thought how American, when I left I thought how very not American. I guess it's something that you  have to  see once though. Kinda reminded me of a day in Ikea   has to be done, but it hurts.",0
15606,"With the amount of people frequenting there daily they should spend some money on renovations, certain areas need upgrading, good things to see but got a bit boring, great place for taking the young ones but",0
22185,"We visited April 27th Through April 30th........a lot of great attractions were closed for refurbishment...which we DID know, as it IS posted on their website (you have to go to the park calendar for this information).....but it was the only time we could go, and it was a trip booked back in January......I understand that there has to be time set aside for refurbishment..and totally appreciate it, but I am not sure I understand why so many of the main rides would need to be closed at the same time....why not stagger popular rides and less popular rides over periods of time rather doing them all at once! yikes!....We have always gone to DL every few years.....this is the first time we've been back in about 3 or 4...and the magic was just not there......it was SUPER crowded, even with a crowd rating of 2 ??!! Strollers EVERYWHERE, screaming babies everywhere, and pushy people everywhere. There were ornery cast members (which I've never seen  ever!), and the park was not as pristine and clean as usual. Things were sticky, and trashes overflowed. And the early morning thing   holy heck! We are huddled into a large mass then set off to run. It's dangerous...and pointless......one extra hour is not enough to do anything anyway (it used to be!). And I was disappointed that fast passes for Racers are gone in just a few hours of the park opening. There needs be a different method. It would be better to limit entry than make people stomp on each other. It would also be better if the park was open longer hours. Both parks, with the exception of Sunday, opened at 10 and closed at 8. Good Grief! On a positive note, this was the first time we were able to catch  The Magic World of Color  and it was awesome.",0
33146,"I've been to Disneyland Paris for the first time, and was a bit disappointed. Several rides were closed for maintenance, and the whole park was small and crowded. I've only managed to get on one ride. Not the best place for young adults, since the park is mostly meant for children. I've been to Disneyland in California, and that was  the real deal!  Disneyland Paris is quite amateur in comparison. ",0
22187,"First let me say that I was in Anaheim on business and had exactly one evening to attend the park Sunday April 6. I assumed since kids were in school and we were not near a holiday the park would be bearable. Unfortunately, everyplace was packed. I was not even able to find the end of the line at Space Mountain. (probably would have spent the evening in line if I did ). Several of the rides that I wanted to go on were closed   Small world, submarines...The park in the evening was dimly lit (not sure if they do this to conserve energy !). Yes , too dimly to even be able to read a map. Surprisingly, we did not see ONE disney character (I don't know did we not do our homework ?..we did not see the parade). Some rides are shut down when fireworks are on..further limiting our rides. So my advice to all is PLAN PLAN PLAN and research the days you are going. Look to see what is closed. Look at less congested days (if they exist) and certainly take advantage of all fast passes that you can get. I don't believe it is even possible to do everything in the park on one day. (that explains multi day packages !).",0
30077,"Disneyland Paris is beautiful, has excellent attractions, it's easy to get to from Disneyland from Paris (but expensive) and the staff is friendly. But goodness me, there are queues everywhere !! When we visited the waiting time for a ride with the train was 120 minutes   just to give an example. The queues to buy ice creams, for the restaurants, merchandise, the toilets   queues everywhere. The capacity of the Park was just so overstretched that I doubt that we will ever return to what is in fact a beautiful park.",0
4318,"This park has limited appeal for those children 12 and upwards, and even less so when a whole section is closed and therefore some of the more adventurous rides not available. It would be good to have notices advising potential customers of the closure of rides as this does effect a person's level of enjoyment at the park. When we visited many, many food   refreshment outlets were also closed which meant limited choice for food and beverage. ",0
24097,"A trip in June to Disneyland and California Adventure turned out to be a bit of a let down because so much has changed there. Not the attractions or upkeep, they continue to be stellar, but the amount of people they let into the park without capping it sooner ruins the experience. Just for the record, many, many babies (not toddlers, but younger) and strollers with children under 2. The stroller situation was incredible. Not a big deal, since Disney is for children and maybe, just maybe these parents had to bring the babies along, too for the day, but I did have about 4 stroller run overs (toes) even when being careful to watch out for them. It was simply a body crush last weekend. This also meant that the crowd control people during the parades, fireworks and Fantasmic were stressed and weren't hiding it well. More irritability than I could have imagined and there wasn't a lot of support for people trying to find a place to watch things. Just herding. Might just be me, but I saw fewer families with mid age children and young teens and more teenagers on the loose together and families with babies. That got a little out of hand. Parents with babies and toddlers out until midnight and the children are screaming and the parents are upset with them (what did they expect? Maybe 9 p.m. was about all they could handle for the day). Lots and lots of spending going on (and yet prices for entrance and stores are significantly higher than three years ago  even during a recession!), as if the merchandise was something special. But the shops have stopped carrying nicer things in a lot of cases and carry cheaply made junk o ramma. Even the candy shop seemed less  hand made  and more like it came in on the truck loaded from a ship coming from China. Sigh. The good ole days are gone, folks. I don't think much is made on the site in the candy area, anyway. Maybe the carmel apples (pricey!!).The Dole Whip booth was a long crowded line from morning to closing with delays of up to an hour and more for those waiting. (Maybe they should put in a larger place for this?) We waited in line TWICE for over 45 minutes without moving more than four people so we left the line and never had the experience. Many people put one person in line for 10 or whatever so Disney, you really should stop that practice, too. Lots of young parents and teens with iphones and other smart phones filming during dark rides and ruining it for EVERYONE else so that they can take home a grainy video for who? They should ask for those to be turned off, too. One guy had his bright IPAD out and on and being held up in front of our faces during Tower of Terror in California Adventure....what??? Okay, so that's the bad stuff. The good stuff is it's Disney, we love the sweetness, the adventure land themes and the frontier areas. We get lost in nostalgia and try to forget the rest. However, creating new memories and reliving old ones are coming at a very high price these days. Disney, must you make the prices SIGNIFICANTLY higher during these hard times for everyone? And why favor the Californians more than anyone else and give them  and only them  a price break unless you buy a season's pass (which is not practical for out of state travelers)? Folks, if you go...expect mostly Californians....and some internationals, but fewer heartland people. They can't afford it. The crowd is decidedly more like Six Flags than it used to be and that's a bit of a mystery. People dropping food containers on the ground during parades and walking away. Really? There are trash cans everywhere! Employees do clean it up nicely, but wow...what has happened to polite crowds?As for Disney, they want money, money, money. They pack 'em in. And while they have mostly great customer service, they don't care about the crush in the park or the experience you're having with that crowding as much as they should. It's kind of a shame on them thing. Wealthy company trying to create more wealth out of their cash cows the theme parks.",0
36367,"Went here in January. Paris in January is beautiful. Disneyland in January is half closed up.We were charged the full ticket rate but half of the attractions were closed due to it being the off season. I found this a bit of a rip off..they could at least warn you the attractions are closed or offer a discounted rate.Having said that, it's still a magical place that will turn any grown adult back into a mesmerised 5 year old!The night parade is the best!",0
22190,"Don't get me wrong, I love all about Disney, the magic, the princess, everything and I'm coming to Disneyland since I was a little girl, but... In the past last years it just seems like is always so packed, lots and lots of people and kids crying and parents getting frustrated everywhere. I have 3 small children, not babies but ages 4 8, it is really hard to keep them happy walking in the heat, waiting lonnnnngggggg lines for every ride. I have a son with a disability, and the past 2 years it was easier with the handicap pass to wait in line, but this year everything is different, they changed everything, so people with disabilities, they have to wait in the sun, like everyone else, they give you this small book and you can ask for a ride one at a time, waiting 1 to 2 hours to go to that ride and Still wait for about 15 min in the heat. Another thing they changed, before, we could go with our son in small parties, maximum 6 per handicap person. Now, it seems like they can put dozens in one party, so, waiting time is longer. I really don't know if we are coming back to Disney, I don't think is worth the price or the effort. Oh, another thing, we found like 6 rides closed this time, Nemo, Pirates, Small World, Indiana Jones, they should at least discount the price of the ticket if they are going to close half of the park. Really Disney, step it up.",0
4321,"There were just so many people. The first part of the day was fine. Parade was nice. There are some interactive parts of the parade when the performers will invite little kids to play. The queues were bearable except some which you may have to wait 45 minsThe tram that goes around disney is usually two way. So we parked the stroller at Fantasy land. Only when we were queuing then they made the announcement that all passengers have to alight at the main station which means we have to walk all the way back to get our stroller. Prepare you video cameras cos right after fantasy land, into tomorrowland, There will be little monsters greeting the passengers. Hahahaha!!!Food and drinks are expensive but it should not be a surprise. Themed parks are all like that. But the food options are really quite limited. dragged her daughter and right past everyone to stand in front for Elsa photo taking. Even after they told her nicely, she became fierce. Most are ok but you have to stand firm and tell them to please not jump q. Some will just ignore you. HahahaThe crowd. The crowd! Where do I start? Where do these people come from. All of a sudden, just before the night parade, throngs of people started appearing from everywhere. It was so crowded, it was impossible to walk. Right after the parade, everyone rushed to the shops. It was IMPOSSIBLE to walk. The people jumped over our stroller, stepped on our feet, without any apologies, like that was the way to go. The park guests were so rude and horrid. They cough into your face and do not queue. Earlier in the day, one Mainland chinese mother,blatantly ignored everyone in the q, she walked past everyone and stood right in front of the queue. When told that she has to q, she became fierce and ignored the comments. How scary...If you are staying at the Disney Hotels, there are frequent bus shuttle services that will bring you to Disneyland but its still a good ten min walk away. If you are travelling with kids, better bring whatever they need. For those who do not wish to pay the entrance fees and still would like to catch the fireworks, feel free to wait at the entrance. There is a nice fountain where you can take pics while waiting for the fireworks to start.Go there knowing that you will have to brave the crowd, you will have fun and survive. Overall, its still a fun place to go",0
30079,Just returned from a wonderful Disney trip but very disappointed with the slow service  in every outlet.  We   ve been to the Disney parks in Florida and there is no comparison with the service provided there.,0
8940,"It is even smaller than the Paris Disneyland, and certainly miniscule compared to the Orlando Disney World   not very impressive, and very very crowded because there were few rides and lots of people! And then it rained and there was nothing to do. We took a day pass, but were done in about half a day.",0
33144,"The Disneyland Paris Park is small, which can be seen as a bit of a bonus, and has a lot of the main attractions that anyone would want to go to Disneyland for. Many of these attractions have either an EU or a French twist, adding a bit of character to the park. There are, however, less shows and experiences than either Disneyland or Walt Disney World. This means that if you are not into the ride experience there is less for you to do. There are also very few rides that pregnant women can go on (not normally a problem, but this time it was an issue).The big drawback with this park is the guests smoking. I wasn't able to go on Pirates of the Caribbean and was pointed towards a waiting area. This should have been a nice area to sit and wait for your party but the benches there were taken up with people so desperate for a cigarette that they lit up as they walked out of the ride. If this wasn't disgusting enough, the  cast members  (a term I use very loosely here) ignore individuals who smoke, walking past people smoking in the middle of Main Street or outside of the rides rather than in the designated smoking areas. Indeed the one place where I didn't see anyone smoking was in the designated smoking areas.The lack of management maintenance of the Disney standard means that I can only suggest that you visit this park if you are a smoker. Otherwise, don't bother!",0

U spent majority of your time in lines than actually enjoying the park. (need a whole day to really enjoy everything)I did enquire about an express pass.. but they said none left. which didn't make much sense to me considering when i entered there actually wasn't an express line.",0
4274,"Hong Kong Disneyland is certainly a fun visit if you have the time, but if you've been to the US parks   don't expect too much. Imagine Disneyland in California. Remove the 'California Adventure' part. Then takes what's left and sort of 'reduce it down' and you have Hong Kong Disneyland. Not terrible, but also rather small and   again   sort of reduced and minimized. They also have a strange opening procedure...I got there early and actually waited in line for the front gate to open, which was fine. However once in they only allow you on Main Street USA at first, keeping you from entering the actual park for about 30 minutes. After THAT, they do a sort of 'rolling opening' of the lands (and don't tell you which open first) so not EVERYTHING is available to do right when you get there. I went to the left to head to Mystic Manor (a GREAT ride, BTW!), only to be stopped and told that area was not opening for another 30 minutes. So I had to completely backtrack to Tomorrowland since that was open. It's just a strange system!",0

36428,"I visited for 4 days & enjoyed everything on offer. It's my 3rd disneyland after Hong Kong & LA. Whilst it delivered on many fronts there are several where I was let down. The nightly fireworks show is all lasers & imagery on water & light on fireworks. Lasts much longer than other parks but far less spectacular. At other parks I went back night after night, here one viewing sufficed. There were quite a few things closed for renovation, most notably Space Mountain & the large carousel. A disappointment for the kids. Lastly the level of service in the shops was nothing but poor. Very slow & poor performing people. If you're choosing I'd try another disneyland. I travelled from Australia & it's a long way to be let down. Average compared to others. ",0
22153,"Rated as average due to the sheer number of guests at Disneyland while we were there. The staff as usual were great, trading pins was great fun. We enjoyed the food, but it was way overpriced costing our family of three 32 dollars for a lunch of: two slices of pizza, two bread sticks, a salad and a drink. Bring your own food.",0
22154,"Our experience began on a day that the park should have been empty.With so many rides down (piriats of the Caribbean, its a small world, finding nemo, Indiana Jones just to name a few), crowds every where, long waits, and the smell of dirty diapers, we will never go agian. At $368 $16 for parking for the family, I should have a guided tour by mickey himself.

While smaller than Disney World, there were many attractions that were being refurbished or out of service for one reason or another. We still did enjoy our trip because it was Disney, but we didn't feel the magic and excitement we had hoped for. All in all, we thought $95.00 for a 1 day pass was not worth it.",0

36423,"We have visited Walt Disney World in Florida on many occasions and always have a great time but decided to check out Disneyland Paris. What a very different experience. The attractions were very good but the park looked rather tired and run down in comparison. Despite many areas being off limits due to alterations there was still need for decoration and updating. This was far from immaculate as we come to expect from Disney with very few cleaning staff in evidence despite groups of them leaning on brushes and chatting in some areas.During our 5 day visit I never saw a toilet attendant and some of the toilets were very smelly and dirty.The main problems I encountered were two fold. The first is that there are smokers everywhere. If you sit on a bench there is likely to be someone next to you blowing smoke. Even in the queues for rides we saw people with cigarettes and one man with a cigar. Secondly, the staff in general let the place down. I hardly saw anyone smile and there was no sense of fun . We had several encounters with over bearing attendants who seemed to be enjoying their power. As an example   we were given a voucher at the hotel for breakfast in the park on one day. The day and time were allocated and our slot was 9am. We had been trying for days without success to try the new Ratatouille ride at the Studios due to fast passes not being available or two hour queues. So, at 10am when the Studios opened a member of our family decided to go to try and obtain a fast pass. He was unsuccessful and returned to the restaurant. However, the attendant at the park entrance would not allow him back in as he had already entered both parks. He was made to stand in a certain spot and wait 5mins until he was told he could enter. This was embarrassing and humiliating and no way to treat a guest.Our other disappointment concerned the 2hours extra time in the park for hotel guests. This was a factor in our choosing a Disney hotel, but in reality, only three rides seemed to be open before 10am.In future we shall return to Orlando where we are welcomed as we should be.",0
36422,"We booked this through a travel agent the whole  Disney Magic  Package including the hotel and were really looking forward to this experience and magical journey. Weren't we wrong!A lot of the theme park was boarded up with green boards that didn't fit the theme around them. Just green boards stating  Mickey is busy building  or whatever it said.It completely took away from the magic of the theme park if we are being honest. really ruined the whole 'escapism' experience.The rides were shoddy and broke down all the time. The staff knew about it with one day being extremely poor and they called it  A Special Day ... Well Im not being funny it wasn't special to us!One main area of the park was pretty much closed (Discovery land) with the restaurants opening when ever they wanted to and closed a lot earlier than the park. The characters were just in the meet and greet spots which required queueing up for 30 minutes a time just to see them or get a picture. I thought they had walk around characters.The staff here looked miserable. A lot of them on mobile phones, walk around staff in red uniforms on mobiles in the arcade walkways near the entrance and on the ride loading. The staff need to be replaced with people who actually want to be there! We witnessed people in the queue in Indiana Jones clearly not tall enough and the staff arguing with them about not being able to ride. No smiles nothing! Iv'e never been so appalled in my life.This trip was a waste of money and I definately won't be recommending it to anyone any time soon. We were also on the hunt for stitch and saw him twice through the whole visit in the Stars and Cars parade thing. Just disappointing really rubbish experienc and the staff we spoke to didn't seem to care.",0
36421,"We went last week with our four year old daughter, who had bought a personalised autograph book to get all the princesses autographs. Throughout the entire day (9:30 18:00) we did not see one single princess. The closest we got was Alice who had a group of unruly children around her. Our daughter has been brought up to queue and wait her turn. She was stood directly in front of Alice for 20 minutes whilst she systematically worked around the children from one side to the other, purposely missing our daughter every time. We waited and waited, then eventually someone came to tell her to leave so they decided a rushed group photo would have to do, then left. Thanks Alice for that lasting childhood memory for our daughter. My advice for anyone else going is just shove your kid to the front and don't give a damn about any other kids, as this seems to be the disney way.Thunder mountain broke whilst we were in the queue, so did the Peter Pan ride, so we couldn't go on these. Space mountain was closed for the entire day and she was too small for the Indiana Jones ride. The shops were well stocked and the best person of the day was the lady making the glass figures who let us buy her first ever small Minnie Mouse that she was working on. Such a pleasant and friendly lady.The rest of the day was mediocre at best and as previously mentioned lacked the magical princesses that our daughter had been dreaming about meeting for months. Save your money and hire a party impersonator instead.",0
36420,"My husband and I love Disney. We have been to Disneyland in California, Walt Disney World in Florida, and Tokyo Disney. We were very excited to visit Disneyland Paris. The park was run down. There were broken light bulbs lying on the ground outside of Phantom Manor. I'm pretty sure that isn't part of the attraction. Once inside, the elevator didn't seem to be functioning properly. Inside the ride, we waited about 20  minutes before being allowed to head towards the doom buggy area. Very strange. We were evacuated from Pirates of the Caribbean. The boats just stopped and the emergency lights turned out without any explanation. The evacuation procedure was efficient and the cast members were very helpful. A few hours later, POTC was up and running again. We decided to give it another go. The ride seemed to be functioning normally until we got to the part where they're auctioning women. The auctioneer's head was dangling from his body... Just hanging there. A child in our boat was visibly freaked out. When we exited the ride, I notified a cast member. Her response was something along the lines of,  Oh yeah, you're the third person who has mentioned that.  Really? You might want to have the pirate's head reattached. It kind of ruins the experience otherwise. The rides will malfunction, I get that. I would happily overlook those malfunctions if the park had not also been dirty. It was by far the dirtiest Disney park we have ever experienced. Trash floating in the water of It's A Small World is not very appealing. Overall, it was an interesting experience. We definitely will not be going back.",0
22157,"For a family of four spending $800 for ONE DAY at a park, there should be a lot of rides to be experienced. Sadly, five rides in one day does not cut it. It was extremely disappointing. The Jungle Cruise, usually a 10 minute wait, was an hour. I'm a Southern California resident so I know this park like the back of my hand. My husband and I experienced a first while waiting in line for this ride. Seriously, in the 100 plus times I've been on this ride, I've never gone UPSTAIRS and INTO another building while waiting in line. This is absurd. Splash Mountain was closed. Star Tours and Indiana Jones both had 90  minute waits. REALLY? IT GETS WORSE. THERE WAS A LINE for Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln (the exhibit that NEVER has a line). Needless to say, it was almost a total waste of $800. We did end up just going down Main Street and checking out every store because we just wanted to get away from the mass of humanity. I hate to complain but there are things that have changed at Disneyland.My biggest complaint, and one that Disney can't do anything about, is that modern technology has made walking through the park a painful experience. I was constantly getting run into or my toes stepped on because people (young and old alike) were too busy looking down at their SmartPhones instead of looking at where they were going. When it's VERY CROWDED, this is a HUGE problem. I ended up with a torn toenail (I was wearing closed toe shoes) because some idiot walked right into me and scoffed the top of my foot with his hiking boot.ANOTHER PROBLEM: While we waited 30 minutes to buy our tickets, my husband's credit card was declined. Turns out the credit card company thought there was some suspicious activity on the card and temporarily suspended it. While my husband was on the phone talking with the credit card company, the window where we were trying to buy tickets closed. I asked the security guard if we had to go to another line and wait again. Yep, we did. The credit card company re activated my husband's credit card and we had to wait another 30 minutes in another line. The whole time my husband was fuming at a seemingly uncaring security guard. Come on, Disney. This is bad customer service. So is allowing these double wide strollers into the park, ESPECIALLY when there is a parade going on. You can't move around well and you get rammed by these strollers because the parents pushing them don't have any perspective.Food wise, it was better than usual. We ate at the Bengal BBQ (across from Jungle Cruise) and the spicy kebabs were surprisingly good. Yes, one kebab won't fill you up, but we ordered a bunch of different stuff and were very happy with the quality. It is not typical Disney fare. Finally. props to the cast members at Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean. The lines were long but the line was constantly moving, which is a good thing. The wait was about 45 minutes for each ride. Food wise, I HIGHLY recommend the kebabs at Bengal Barbecue. Also, the burgers at Taste Pilot (California Adventure) are good. If you have the luxury of making reservations and want a real Disney experience, eat a Monte Cristo (at $25, it's the cheapest entree on the menu) at the Blue Bayou. Note: for a family of four, you won't get out of here for less than a $100. If you can afford to splurge, eat at Napa Rose at California Adventure. It's outstanding. Local resident tip: If you happen to visit this park in December, don't miss the ride It's a Small World. They change all of the doll's costumes to reflect a winter theme. ALSO... check out the fire station on Main Street with your little ones. You can decorate holiday cookies with the firemen and keep the cookies!",0
4281,Not as many attractions as in the USA.  Overpriced . Many rides were out of service for maintenance.   The good thing was not a crowd at the rides. It was still a good experience.,0
4283,"I've been to the HK Disneyland twice and the first time we made the mistake of going during December January which was a terrible idea! We waited more than an hour for each ride and it was so crowded, I swore never to return. I went again last year but during an off peak season, April and we stayed at the Disney Resort. Disneyland will ALWAYS have lots of people but luckily it wasn't so crowded and the longest we waited for a ride was probably 10 15min which really isn't so bad. I was disappointed however that customers who stayed at the resort didn't get exclusive access or anything at the theme park. The Theme Park itself is very small so 1 day is definitely enough to go on all the rides. ",0
15617,"Have been to Disneyland many times over the past half century and always was impressed with the management of the Park...until this time. Lines were impossible, litter on the ground, many closed attractions, mean staff pushing people aside during the night time parades, grout coping missing around tiles, ran out of silverware at the French Market restaurant during lunch and no one clearing the tables when everyone was looking for a clear table to sit down, faucets not working in bathrooms at Disney Grand Hotel in the main lobby, nowhere to sit in the Lobby at the Disney Grand Hotel, no entertainment while standing in lines in the Park that lasted hours, etc., I know, operating Disneyland (when packed) with the highest levels of service is a management feat, but when I've visited the Park before, management always came through, performed brilliantly. But the attention to detail that always seemed to be the signature of Disneyland was just off this time. Just like in their recently released movie, Jungle Book, in which the boy, supposedly raised in the jungle, walks barefoot in the opening scenes like a city kid who has never walked barefoot much of anywhere, repelling slightly from pebbles and other impediments in his path. We went over to the California Adventure side to escape the crowds but same problems with lines on popular rides like the one at Radiator Springs that lasted more than two hours with possibly some of the worst background music to which I have ever been subjected. Nothing to look at amuse one self with while in line except some cactus and some bottles in the walls which, thankfully, people on the other side of the wall flashed their iphones behind to give the impression of mystery lights. When I was a kid, I remember taking the boat trip through the jungle in the main Park, and the lines were long, but the kids operating the ride seemed to have been junior comedians in training and kept cracking corny jokes which made the time in line seem to pass more quickly. But this time, in the long line rides, like the Toy Story ride, there was nothing to distract, just a mechanical Mr. Potato Head who occasionally said something. There was a kid cutting in line, apparently wanting to ride again without waiting, he told me, he had lost his babysitter, and his parents had told him to look for her in the line. He said this as he darted ahead, probably cutting the time waiting in this 90  minute line, down to about five or ten minutes. (I expect to see him embroiled in the next Enron scandal in about ten years  a very slick operator for a 12 year old.)As crowded as the Park was, I couldn't help thinking that possibly the ticket pricing was off, or that Disneyland had sold too many annual passes and wasn't predicting well how many of the annual passholders would visit the park on any given day. Overall, it was just too crowded.",0
36414,"Disney is magic, Disneyland Paris is short of it.  I visited the US Florida Parks, first time over 20 years ago, and always been happy and impressed, by the Cast, services, food and facilities.   In Paris something is missing, not magical, it's ok but no WOH!",0
4284,"You should only visit Disneyland Hong Kong of you are accompanying children. Nothing major for adults to explore at the park and as far as the rides are concerned, each and every ride at ocean park is much better than Disneyland. Food options at the park are rather overpriced and so are the souvenir shops. So in a nutshell only worth it for kids and Disney aficionados.",0
24101,"Coming from a person who has been to Disneyland since its opening in the 50's, I think Walt would be ashamed that they once again have raised their prices to the extent that most young families can't afford even one day in the park.. Might I suggest that maybe keeping prices down and quit making the park bigger and bigger, pushing the parking lots farther and farther away, that you give a discount to  families  and let them show their kids and grand kids the joy of Disneyland without going deeply in debt! It seems that the  locals  in So Calif get all the discounts, with the So Cal Select Pass. The park has too many people but after 5pm, when the locals get off work, the park is way over filled with local kids and such. It just isn't the same Disneyland that it was when I was a kid.. Sad, very sad..",0
22160,"This is our second visit to Disneyland. We visited 2 years ago in November and had a great time. The wait times for rides was reasonable. This visit has been a different experience. Our research indicated that May is a less crowded time. As well we visited mid week hoping to avoid the crowds. We found it very crowded and the lines for attractions were long. We used the fast pass system today which helped. The line up for the Matterhorn was huge all day. We finally got on right before closing. Some of the major attractions were closed (Pirates, Indiana Jones, Small World) which was disappointing. We still had a good time and have one more day on our 3 day pass. I don't think well come back. If this is supposed to be  low season  I would never come during a peak time. It wouldn't she worth it if it were any more crowded than what we've faced son this trip.Had a good meal at the ESPN restaurant in downtown Disney.",0
22162,"Disneyland is still a fun place but for starters, the cost to get in the gate detracts from being  the happiest place on earth . I was last at Disneyland in 1984. Today, they have added $16.00 parking (used to be free), and $92.00 entry EACH. If you are a kid, you get a $6.00 cut to $86.00. If you are a senior, veteran, handicapped, they don't seem to care. Walt Disney would not have been so inconsiderate of seniors, vets, and handicapped. After having visited Disneyland four (4) times in the 80's, I am now so disappointed that I will never encourage anybody to visit them.",0
36408,"We visited in May and was in this park for a total of 1 and a half hours, a lot of the rides were closed, we were in the park for 10.30 and leaving at 12 it was no better! Not the Disney I know and remember! ",0
22163,We had a good time. In the Park 3 days. Would have needed at least 2 more days to ride everything. Lots of rides were closed though which was a little disappointing. Also the line ups for the Princesses was insane. So we didn't bother to wait to see any.The rides we did ride were amazing! My kids loved all of them. It definitely feels magical! I was shocked how many people were at the park for a May beginning of the week though,0
36406,"If you have small children who never been to theme park and you accidentally found 500 EUR and you want to spent it in old fashioned park, then enjoy! Otherwise go to any water park or theme park close to your house, buy a few Mickey and Elsa clothes from ebay and you will have better experience.Most of the attractions were built 15 years ago and nothing changed since. One third of attractions was out of order because of wind, rain or just broken. For other smaller attractions (such simple carousel or car driving range) you will wait  just  20 minutes. For the bigger ones you have to wait 60 80 minutes in a queue. That is terrible and even waiting 20 minutes with 3 years kid for 1 minute ride ... not worth the 200 EUR entrance fee for the family.It was a huge disappointment for us. Even the simple fun like Disney characters in costumes which you would expect to be on every corner are rare to meet. They appear few times a day and there is another 30 minutes queue to get a hug from Mickey! How expensive could be to buy ten costumes of Mickey and hire ten people to walk among visitors?The prices of Disney merchandising and refreshments are enormous. Make yourself a baguette with ham and you will safe tens of euro.",0
4290,"If this was your first Disneyland experience, this was ok but not great. For those who are use to American style amusement parks, this would be a bust. You can walk the whole park in about an hour or two and the limited rides were not that exciting as it is here in Calif or Florida.",0
36404,"Last week we went on a much anticipated trip to Disneyland Paris, to celebrate my 30th birthday, as I am a huge Disney fan, and a big kid at heart. I had visited Disneyland Paris four times previously, between 1992 and 2008, and had always had a magical trip. Sadly, this trip did not live up to my magical expectations, and I'm afraid to say I will not visit Disneyland Paris again. We stayed at Davy Crockett Ranch. Immediately on arriving we were disappointed by the amount of building work going on around the site, it looks unpleasant, untidy, and certainly not magical. The cabin itself was adequate, we did have an ant infestation however upon asking this was seen to, a bug bomb was put in the cabin whilst we were out and we didn't see any more. We were surprised there was no toaster, neither was there a grill to make toast. The equipment in the cabin was poor, and added to the feeling that we were constantly being encouraged not to eat in the self catering accommodation, instead spending our money in the parks. There was some confusion when booking as one of the Disney sites advertised a Premium Plus cabin, the other only a Premium. This was not fully explained to me and I was under the impression our cabin included free wired internet, the receptionist would not budge on this and said we would have to pay. The  village  area of the camp looked a state, with scaffolding and dust everywhere. The pool was closed all day Tuesday, then on Wednesday we called Reception, who couldn't tell us if it was open, so we went down there anyway, checked in and given no advice, to get into the pool and find the Jacuzzi, flume and rapids were all broken. The pool was a big draw for us and so this was extremely disappointing and we did not visit again. On the Thursday my parents tried to visit the bar at 2pm, only to be shouted at that it was closed.  Overall, the lack of facilities, equipment, and the general ambience that we had been promised were not provided. Onto the parks. We were aware that Space Mountain, Captain EO, and the Carousel were undergoing maintenance. What we did not expect was huge, ugly boarding surrounding those rides and completely ruining the image.  We visited the parks Monday afternoon and evening, Tuesday and Wednesday all day, and most of Thursday. Not once did we see any characters, at all. It seemed the only opportunities to get photos with the characters was to pay for an expensive character meal, which again made us feel like the park was money grabbing. We visited Planet Hollywood on Monday evening, to be sent downstairs to the dingy overflow seating, sat at a booth with peeling furniture taped up, and served plain, expensive burgers. The whole part of the restaurant looked tired and in need of DIY, as did so much of the park. Everywhere we looked were broken parts, peeling furniture, it really felt like the owners just don't care as long as people spend their money. The loos were always grubby and the automatic flushes were faulty, going off whilst sat down, not pleasant! The staff were almost all extremely rude, on one occasion a cleaner ran into me with their wheelie bin, as he was pushing it from behind, and instead of apologising shouted  attention!!  at me. Other staff seemed to flout the rules; we waited 60 minutes as a couple for Ratatouille, to find we shared our ride with a couple who had waited 30 minutes in the  single  rider queue. Other ride disappointments came when we were told it was too windy for the parachute drop and RC Racer ride, only to walk away and see them working literally five minutes later. Other rides such as the train around the Disneyland Park only had one train operating, ridiculous as the wait was then 60 minutes, use another train and you cut that in half. Lastly, despite signs everywhere stating  no smoking , people were smoking everywhere, in queues, in front of children, which is disgusting. I was just so disappointed that my big birthday treat was not what I expected, and that the management of the park has gone so downhill, when it used to be so magical. I spent a lot of money on this holiday, but I wish I had stayed at home, it really was a waste of my hard earned money and I will never visit again.",0
13109,"MY wife and I took four grandkids to Disneyland over this spring break. $20 for parking. $732.00 for one day tickets. 2 bottles of water $7. 5 pieces of pizza and two drinks $49. two ball caps, a drinking cup, and a small snow globe as gifts   $97. And in that time we were there the kids went on 9 rides total. Sorry, but Disneyland is made up of waiting in lines, crowds of people, and high prices. It's for the kids. How do families who can't really afford this go here? ",0
30067,This is a deteriorating park where most rides break down and is just a waste of money. I don   t understand how the Disney brand can stay quiet on the many breakdowns that happens here. Some staff also seem uninterested in working there to be honest. Tokyo disney was a million times better,0
4294,"The place is simply overly crowded. You could easily spend 20 mins queuing for almost every popular program, It is a pain when you travel with young kids. The variety of games available is also too limited. Will NEVER go back.",0
36399,This is another Disney park like the others in the world. I found it rather small as compared to the others. We made an attempt to cover both the parks in a day and that turned out to be a good idea.,0
15544,"The Good: it's the happiest place on earth, or it is usually. The Bad, with Star Wars going in, Tomorrowland is closed, and there is so much construction going on even in other areas. Maybe it was the week I was there, but so many things were not open, or working properly. When I went to complain at Town Hall, the guy was really nice, but just gave me 3 fast passes. With 3 of us having annual passes and 2 of us having just paid for 3 day hoppers, they should have done more. BTW, that was 3 fast passes just for one person......me, which just ain't right. ",0
30126,"Keep in mind, I am coming at this with Disney Fan eyes. I am a huge fan and have been to Orlando parks several times and even to California. I went to Paris Disney with an understanding that I have been to the  World , and this was just the  Land . Even with that, I was still disappointed. We did have a good time, don't get me wrong. My family can make fun any where they go, but this was definitely missing that Magic Fairy Dust that covers all elements of a true Disney experience. It felt very  Six Flags  to me.We did both parks in one day (open to close). The lines were long(but hey that's Disney). What killed a big chunk of our time was waiting for our food. I understand that France has a whole different philosophy on ordering food etc but fast food is fast food. They really need to work on that. Over an hour waiting for burgers and fries? What I found stood out the most was the lack of cleanliness that goes along with the Disney standards. The rides, restaurants, and general park looked a little in need of a face lift. The character costumes looked like ones you would tent for a kids birthday party. And the employees all needed a little cheering. They were all rather miserable. They were employees rather than  cast members .In my opinion, go, have fun. But just don't expect that WOW factor that goes along with the Disney label. I'm glad I went. No regrets. I can now say I've been. ",0
30127,"We spent a day here on Monday 9th July. We had a fun day, having arrived at around 2pm and leaving at 8.30pm we only managed 6 rides including the parade. We were fine with this as perhaps we could have done a few of the kiddie ones and got a few more in. A few rides were closed which was disappointing. There's no option for proper fast pass. The queues are a bit excessive. The park has so many shops it's insane. Out to get your money for sure.All in we did have a fun day but had to leave before the fireworks which were on at 11pm?! Who with or without kids can stay that late at a park when the rides closing before then.Good for a one off but if I had paid for a full family and all the food, drinks and merchandise you would end up buying for kids I would opt for elsewhere to be honest.",0
36028,"We came to Disneyland Paris at 27.6.15 and were completely overwhelmed by the crowd and long lines to almost every attraction. In most of the cases, lines to most of the rides were between 30 and 60 minutes of wait, which, considering hot weather and lack of shadow in some of the most popular rides lines, was unacceptable. I tried the fast pass option, but waiting time for the fast pass was around 6 7 hours   for example, trying to get tickets for the Piter Pen's flight at 11 AM resulted in tickets to 17:55PM. At this rate, there is absolutely no way that visitor can use the 2 Parks hopper ticket, you spend most of the time in lines and when you're finished   it is 11 PM and you have no time left to visit the second park.  So my advice is to order your tickets for one park only   you'll save some money and won't be that disappointed.  Food is overpriced and small frozen Micky Pizza costs 12 Euro, which is almost the price of really great freshly made pizza elsewhere. Same goes for the drinks, ice cream and snacks. Even at seemingly high class restaurants the food is average at best and overpriced to the level of Michelin star restaurants.  Frozen  special appearance by Anna and Elza is no more than carriage ride with actors opening their mouth to the theme song of the movie. I was utterly disappointed and even my daughter said that Elza was  strange, made funny faces and her mimics was unnatural . Afternoon Disney Parade was actually quite nice, but once again, huge crowds prevented all but tallest people or kids on parents shoulders to get a clear view of the characters.  Light show on the castle was actually impressive, but it starts too late and some children just don't make it to that hour (11pm).Long story short   come before or after summer and maybe you'll have your chance to enjoy that place. Otherwise   management should consider restricting access to the park during high season in order to improve the experience for all visitors.  ",0
36022,Same ole Disney stuff but in french. Picked up a good Bagherra and it was just Disney. Everything is always the same. Miss the original,0
36023,"Visited eurodisney with a 4 year old and 1 year old, first time at a Disney park. Not massively impressed and I think peppa pig world was better to be honest, in terms of rides and quality, for a 4 yr old anyway, perhaps not fair comment for older children,First day in fantasyland, there was quite a bit closed but we took our 4 year old on the pincoccjio 'ride' which is a stilted ghost train type which she was a bit scared of, it's quite a dark story, then the Peter pan ride which through the eyes of a 34 yr old seemed a bit old, 4 yr old liked it though. We fast tracked that one which means you book ahead scanning your park ticket then come back at a designated time, that was a v good idea. Dumbo ride was ok on a par with peppa pig balloon rides, over pretty quickly. The main thing about Disney is the shops, a massive proportion is shops of Disney merchandise, nice quality clothes and hats, cuddley toys etc. we made the mistake of going to a burger place for lunch which was ok not greAt, 35 euro for 2 adults and 1 child so not ok ish price, second day we did baguettes which were much better in the studios, we had snack vouchers for 3 6pm but the designated places had massive queues so we didn't use vouchers, frozen sing along was v good and we were lucky to get in. The parade however was very good and not seeing many of the characters during the 2 days it was good to see them all, worth hanging around for. Buffet restaurants in the park are genuinely good with nice food choices so if you have vouchers it's good to go to these. Only regret we didn't go on Nemo ride as it looked good but 4 yr old too small... All in all glad we went but won't be hurrying back ",0

36037,"While in Paris last year I took one day to visit Disneyland Paris. Being a avid Disney Park goer, how could I not go. The Disney's Paris Magic Kingdom is definitely the most beautiful of all the Magic Kingdoms. The grounds are unbelievable. However the one most important thing missing is the cast member friendliness. Now they are not rude but you can definitely tell that this is just a job for them. The rides (especially Phanton Manor Best Disney Haunted Mansion) are great and the food is actually more superior than that of the other Disney parks. But unfortunately the  Disney Magic , you don't feel it there. If you are a big Disney Park fan like me and happen to be in Paris, definitely check it out. However make it one of your last destinations in Paris. Don't make it your priority. The train ride out there is fun and you'll see beautiful country side. Great break for kids while in Paris.",0
30211,"We travelled to Disneyland Paris with our toddler, baby son and my niece. This is the first time my children have been and maybe the only time my niece gets to go.Having travelled to Disney Paris and Orlando as a couple, it was an eye opening experience for the first time travelling with a family. I would highly recommend you bring in your own food and drink (or refillable bottle) as a bottle of water and an ice lolly with set you back 7 Euros.I really wanted to enjoy this holiday and more importantly I wanted the kids to enjoy it. Our initial disappointment came with the large number of main attractions that were closed for renovation (Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor and the Mat Hatter Tea Cups).More annoyingly we had 5 rides break down within the 2 days we were at the park, either when we were on it, before we got to it or after we had queued for it!These were:1. Peter Pans Flight   broke down while riding for 10 15 minutes2. Buzz Lightyear Ride   broke down 3 times while riding3. Slinky Rollercoaster   broke down half way through queuing4. Aladdin Magic Carpet Ride   broke down immediately after Slinky Dog ride5. Armageddon experience   was closed when we walked past and then had technical difficulties as soon as it re openedOther guests also informed me that Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Aerosmith Rockin Roller Coaster also broke down the day we were at the studios.Hardly the experience you hope for when you pay   696 for park tickets. Several parts of other rides were also clearly not working, including one of the trams on the studio backlot tour, which increased queuing times.The staff at customer services were friendly and offered us VIP fast pass tickets for the remainder of our stay. However, as I complained more than halfway through our 2 day visit, the kids were already beside themselves tired and has returned to the hotel, so we couldn't make best use of the tickets.I hope someone from the park reads this as the high amount of technical problems and closed rides is hardly worth the full price of admission. Not all rides have fast passes either. Crushes Coaster was a 75 minute wait when the park opened and a 90 minute wait when the park closed. The Princess pavillion had a wait of 60 75 minutes all day and in the end you only meet one princess and you don't get to choose which! thank goodness my daughter loves beauty and the beast!",0
30210,"Huge, huge queues to every attraction, everytime. You have to stay in line 90% of the time of your day here. And they could implement electronic queue   just with digital screens and numbers   no, dear guests, you HAVE TO stay in queue with all your kids in these huge queues to enter in every attraction in Disney Land Paris. Please, hire Herman Gref to manage this place   he certainly knows how to work with overcrowded areas (see Sberbank case, please). Very bad managed business, sorry for that.",0
8844,"First, it takes a long time to get there. And the park isn't big enough that you'd want to spend more than a day there, so staying at one of their hotels to cut down the travel time isn't necessary. Second, it's super crowded. Every line is an hour long or more. It's intensely boring to stand in line one hour for something you know is going to last last than 2 minutes. Third, it's expensive. Ocean park is significantly cheaper, bigger and better. So unless you have very small children who love Disney stuff, don't go. If you do, they pump you for money at every turn. If you want your picture taken with any of the characters you have to sign up for a separate package. My only tip is if you really do go, try and get your tickets in advance. Even the lines to buy tickets there are really long.",0
36033,"I didn't read reviews of DLP before booking... I had this overwhelming thought that everyone would be super gushy about 'Disney Magic', Fantastic, amazing etc, etc....I wish I had now... I would have been more prepared. I HATED IT! Every minute I was there. Being British I truly am the stereotypical  wait your turn ,  don't push in .... but we were barged passed, shouted at, ignored by Spanish pushy mothers (and fathers!!) getting their precious little darlings first into anything! Lines to meet characters were a joke (as there was almost no such thing) and the variations of photo poses kid with character, mum with character, dad and mum with character, dad, mum, auntie, next door neighbour, next door neighbours cousin.... was totally laughable!! Again, when our turn, understanding it was 40 degree heat and everyone was a bit jaded, our photo was our precious little darling and character and then leaving!!! The only saving grace for the whole time there was Davy Crockett's ranch. It was a nice reprieve from the sun, being located in a shady forest, the downside was no one mentioned it was under full construction and was a bit of a building site! The pool was a blessing, and the food was ok (we were Half board   so saved from the 30 euro per head to eat in the Disney Park   would have been 150 euro a meal to eat there for four days.... that is the cost of another holiday!!)I thought DLP was a rip off. The queues were unbearable. There was no Disney 'magic' to anything at all.... my daughter was so distraught when waiting her turn for an autograph at the Studio 'circle' that Remy Rat signed every Spanish person's book, they were coming over my head, through my arm space and when I tried to assert myself he pushed my hand away!!!!! I wanted to scream! Then when they stopped the circle before she met Ariel I couldn't console her.... it was just heartbreaking. There seemed to be no order or method to what they were doing. People queuing to meet a character and then them saying actually we only have a couple of minutes and you will have to come back in an hour.... I felt like saying these people have paid thousands of pounds to do this, I think they deserve to meet the man in the dressing up kit, dont you!! I just wasn't impressed at all. It is a glorified Disney shop with a few rides thrown in.... and a lot of them not working boarded up.I sound really miserable... and I really am the least miserable person I know. But I wish I had booked a week in Paris and a day trip to Disney   don't I would have felt so hard done by!",0
15449,"We've been long time Premium Pass holders, spending 18 of our last 20 New Years (& 1 2 extra trips every year) at The Happiest Place On Earth, & decided to combine a last minute trip to Disneyland with a business trip before our passes expire, as we may not renew them due to the price increase. We went in & were shocked to discover the crowds due to ALL the ride, show & attraction closures in preparation for Star Wars Land. It was even more crowded than New Years Eve! I still love Disneyland, but we are probably going to forgoe our annual Family New Years tradition and wait until Star Wars Land opens for the next trip! I feel sad for any first time visitor because this is not the happy place I so dearly love! See photos that were taken at 4:30ish, Saturday 5 21 16 from the bridge in front of the Pirates of the Caribbean, which is also out of commission as a walk way.",0
36035,"Just back from a family trip to EuroDisney Paris. It was everything I feared it would be ... but far worse! To sum up my experience in three words: Queues, queues, queues.The bad. The weather was unbearably hot, 100F, not Disney's fault I know this would not have been nearly as bad if it wasn't for all the time required to be outdoors queuing. I would never go again in summer. Food overpriced. Merchandise overpriced. Not enough picnic and play areas. Kids got bored and tetchy with queues. The good   the staff were all very friendly and well trained whilst doing a very stressful job with stressed customers. Felt safe on rides. The other guests were also very polite despite the sufferance. Shame that smoking was allowed in the park. I know outdoors but why should I have to breath in other peoples filth whilst standing in queues and watching parades? Parade good. Park buildings and landscaping lovely.Monday. I arrived by packed shuttle bus which was full to bursting and crawled through rush hour traffic. I waited 15 minutes to get my bag xrayed at security. I then waited thirty minutes to get my pre paid ticket even though the queue was short and the counters fully manned. Why is this process so slow when the kids are desperate to get into the park. I then waited ten more minutes at park entry. I then set off to 'Adventureland' and walked to the Pirates ride and waited forty minutes   which then promptly shut down due to a technical fault just as I was about to board. So we went instead to the haunted house which said 15 minutes queuing time but which was 45 minutes in extreme heat. Haunted house story was all in French and therefore meaningless. And that was my morning. In the afternoon thought about the Frozen sing a long but queues were prohibitive. Went on Thundermountain in afternoon with a fastpass ticket   it was good but still had to wait twenty minutes. Gave up with other rides due to queues and went to some of the lesser attractions instead. Tuesday: Walked thirty minutes to park to avoid bus overcrowding. Found secondary entrance with no queues. Went to 'Fantasyland' but Peterpan ride shut due to technical fault. Did a few rides but generally disappointed with the quality and length of rides. Not nearly as good as I'd expected. Waited an hour for the star wars simulator which was good but not worth the tortuous queue. Queues for toilet, queues for water fountain. Gave up and retreated to hotel at this point and returned in the evening. Evening parade good. Jaques Cousteaux future ride closed. Gave up queuing for Automania. Went to rockets instead   said 15 minute queue but was twice that for 1 minute ride. Laser firework show at castle excellent and highlight of show..Wednesday: went to Disney studios park. Rushed to Crush ride early to avoid queues only to wait 70 minutes for a 60 second rollarcoaster in the dark. Massively disappointed. Meanwhile, another family member had to wait 20minutes just to get a fastpass ticket for Ratatouie. Went to a animalmajique show which was pants. Went to Ratatouie which had just broken down. So gave up and went back to the hotel for a swim instead. Thursday. Had a morning before flying home. Tried to go on rides that had been unable to get on previously. But pirates shut again. When did return, queues forty minutes long and, unlike my companions, I was not prepared to endure. Went on 'behind the scenes' tram   which was just garbage. Peter Pan ride was closed again but then reopened. It was so dark I couldn't see anything! I'm told this is a problem in the summer because there is not time to allow your eyes to adjust! Summary. Any other company expecting families with young children to queue for hours in the baking sun would be prosecuted for child abuse! I don't understand why people tolerate the queues ... the park clearly is all about the rides and yet can't accommodate so many people. The same people that would blow a fuse if they had to wait for half an hour in an airport security line for a two hour,   60 plane trip seem to be remarkably tollerant when waiting an hour and more for a sixty second mickey mouse ride with their family   when they have paid thousands of pounds for the privilege. Everywhere I looked I saw strained parents and frustrated kids all frazzling in the heat. Disney are so sneaky about the queues. First you stand for twenty minutes in the sun to get to the entrance of the attraction, and the queue doesn't look so bad; then you turn a corner to be confronted with a cattle shed of people twisting back and forth hidden round the side of the attraction  thirty more minutes; then you enter the building where you spend another twenty minutes in corridors constantly going round bends but not knowing how much longer you have to endure. If anyone could see the length of the queue from the onset they would never join in the first place. I do not know how this place averages a rating of four stars; it's just not worth the pain and misery and the money!",0
36021,"i have been to Anaheim Disney 6 times and have just been to the Paris Park last week. The appearance is very shabby, dirty and everyone was smoking which surprised me. The park is way smaller yet more expensive and the park didn't open til 10am! Disney in Anaheim opened at 7am. A lot of rides were closed and it was height of summer. Very disappointing. The food inside the park was generic and over priced as well. Staff were not 'disneylike' and hardly spoke regardless of what language. I can converse in three languages yet none of the staff could give a hoot. Just basically ignored people. Even in most shops there were four or five cash registers yet only one open at a time and a line formed for a massive wait time just to purchase a toy. Very slack work ethic. Hardly any characters around either for the little kids. In four days I saw Pinocchio, eeyore, and lilo and stich. That's it! In Usa, the characters are in every land all the time, the place is clean, and the staff magical to combine a magical experience. In Paris, it's nothing more than dirty expensive playground where you line up for hours and then the ride may break, like the Big Thunder Rail ride did for us. Won't be returning here. ",0
4554,"This is a Disney of sorts but if you are looking for all the hype that surrounds Disneyland this is not for you. The rides are meant for small people so, while it is good for the locals, it is not great for tourists who may not be economical is size. We took the kids once because they wanted to compare it to Disneyland California. Not much to compare. ",0
30214,"Visited the park for one day as part of a longer holiday in France. First went when it first opened in 92 & our last time was around 6 yrs ago. Really looked forward to taking our 4yr old for his first time. The day started well with Ratatouille ride but after a boring ride on studio tours (which needs updating) there was nothing left in studios to entertain a 4yr old without queueing for at least 45 50mins so we moved on to the main park.The park is still immaculate (though some of the toilets left plenty to be desired   yuck) but it's lost it's magic and sparkle. There were no characters spotted out and about, though we did spot a princess moving through the park heavily cloaked and escorted least anyone stop to ask her for a photo. Loads of rides were either closed or had really long queues and looked   felt tired and shabby. Staff were just employees, not Disney ambassadors   we experienced a few curt and rude exchanges in shops and restaurants despite conversing in French. The whole thing felt like an enterprise in packing people in and making money, which although it was always thus, you never felt like did before. It's so sad to see the neglect in entertaining people and making it magic for them. I was still entranced 6yrs ago, this time I was weary and fed up, we didn   t even stay for final parade which we   ve always stopped for. It needs an overhaul and some new rides creating based on later films plus the free roaming characters bringing back   they add to the magic people expect.",0
36018,Disneyland Paris is a very nice place but needs another park and more fast passes. The amount of people the hotels have in them it needs another park because even tho we went when the kids are at school it was so busy. Some rides you had to wait for 90 mins. People don't stick to the smoking areas they just smoke where they want and the cast members don't do nothing about it. I expected more from Disney. I love Disney but Disney Paris is no where near as good as Florida. I would highly recommend saving more money up and going to Disney in America.,0
22393,"We visited Disneyland twice, Mar 25 and Mar 28th. Splash mountain broke down (40Min), Cars broke down (45 Min), Matterhorn broke down (60M Min) Toy story broke done (closed), Space mountain broke down (Closed), Indiana Jones was closed for refurbishment, It's a small world was closed for for refurbishment, Finding Nemo was closed for refurbishment.Our family has enjoyed many wonderful days in Disney land but we have never experienced this level of brake down or closures. What has changed?",0
15441,"I never thought that one day I would stop loving Disneyland but my last visit was so disappointing that I don't think I will ever go back. Visited on a Monday in mid May hoping to avoid the weekend and summer crowd. Bought a one day park hopper ticket $160. From the parking lot through the entrance it took one hour to get in. Waited in line for security, waited in line for ticket, waited in line to get through the gate. 10 11 am. Then waited in line 15 min for restroom. There was such a crowd that you could not drop a needle. Average wait for entry to a ride was 45 min. Some rides were giving out fast passes at 11 am, to return at 9 pm! Children were crying and upset with exhausted parents trying to cut through the crowd. Scooters, strollers, wheelchairs were blocking foot traffic there was so many of them, 20 min wait for an ice cream, long lines in front of restaurants, Blue Bayou restaurant was reserved 3 days ahead! You won't be able to eat there unless you make reservation many days prior to your arrival. I used to have a yearly pass 10 15 years ago, Disneyland was nothing like this. Disneyland has much to offer but the crowds are unbearable, frustration are on the face on most people. Disneyland is becoming a nightmare. I would rather spend my day anywhere else.",0
30215,"Our trip to Disneyland Paris is as one might expect: fun rides with excessive queues but plenty of spills and thrills, well worth waiting an hour, sometimes more, to get on. No positive surprises, unfortunately, but plenty of negative ones. Food and beverage prices are astronomical. Maybe not such a surprise that prices were high but the scale of the    daylight robbery    was. The worst surprise was the absolutely appalling customer service throughout the park, the worst of which we experienced at the American Diner. We were ignored upon arrival and seated some five minutes later. The choice was minimal, each of us taking a burger. The order took a very long time to arrive after at least a couple of reminders to staff. Other customers who ordered after us has almost finished their food before ours arrived. My son   s burger was raw in the middle. Our complaint was met with laughter and a patronising comment from a waitress. She said she   d have another prepared. We said we   d not wait another thirty minutes for another burger but were prepared to pay for the acceptable sandwiches, not the raw one. She declined, saying our order was already in the till and laughed. We had to wait at least a further ten minutes while she made a call to resolve the issue. In the end, we paid for the three burgers which were properly prepared and not the underdone one. All this, in an overheated space with flies buzzing around. I sought out a bag for a relative in one of the larger shops. I showed a woman at a till an image of the piece I   d like. She told me that if it wasn   t in the store, they didn   t have it. I asked, if it was in the store, where might it be. She said she didn   t know. It could be anywhere. Dreadful. Everything else was quite nice. ",0
30216,"While in Paris my niece and I made a spur of the moment trip to Disneyland. I'd heard all of the jokes about how terrible it is   so our expectations weren't high. We had a nice time. My biggest complaint is the number of rides that weren't working or were being refurbished (Teacups, Pirates of the Carribean, Haunted Manor and several others I wasn't familiar with from the Orlando Park). There was also a general lack of customer satisfaction or  hustle  to get people through lines and onto rides quickly. Also disappointed with the photopass. I'm normally a sucker for the photopass at Disney or Universal. This one was $79, but there are only 6 rides that take photos and two of them are closed. Maybe it's worth it if you do a Princess breakfast. I would maybe go again if I was in Paris for two or more weeks  but it's not worth the trip if you've got limited time in Paris.",0
36013,"We've been to Disneyland in California and Walt Disneyworld in Florida a number of times. Disneyland Paris just doesn't measure up. It is smaller, less up to date and generally lamer. Also, lots of little things   it is more run down, less clean and staff is not as good. Kind of feels like it was done on the cheap. First hint was the cashier taking food orders was simultaneously taking orders and scrolling through Facebook on her phone. One parade a day   and a lame one at that   things in disrepair, dirty bathrooms, etc. etc. Definitely not up to Disney standards. Shame on Euro Disney management. ",0
36012,So disappointed   they let far too many people into this much smaller version of Disneyland and it is hideously overcrowded. Waiting times for EVERYTHING are at least 35 mins according to the signs but that is a massive lie. Even the Fast Track is ridiculous as we tried at 11am and the come back time was 3.50pm. What a joke for small children. The parents are incredibly aggressive considering it is a kids theme park... where is the love?? The waiting obviously short circuits brains. They should restrict how many people enter the park and maybe it might be more enjoyable. Hated it and couldn't wait to get out of there and the food??? Fried food extravaganza.. horrible. Would never go again and strongly advise parents to find another park to go to... there is another fantastic park around Paris that we went to with rides etc and no waiting. If you have older kids maybe ok but for young children waiting an hour per time to get on a ride is not a fun day for them and even less so for their parents.,0
36011,Although it still has many attractions and some of them very good.  I think its time to start re investing some of the profits back into the park.  It is starting to look very tired.,0
36010,Went to park for 2 days in early may and booked tickets through UK travel agent who promoted the fast pass as an added extra unfortunately fast pass isn't fast pass at all it is an advanced cueing system available to everyone so doesn't work at all managed to get on 3 rides the first day went back 2nd day and fast pass cues where already past 3pm so we left having spent   200 to go on 3 rides so really not hsppy,0
30217,"It's hard to believe this Disney park and Disney in Orlando are part of the same company. The staff in Orlando couldn't be more friendly if they tried and every staff member I encountered in Euro Disney were rude, sour faced and obviously hate there jobs... The park it self is nicely laid out and clean.. The kids loved it but I will not return simply because of the attitudes of the French staff members..",0

30219,"I liked this park, but it has a ways to go before it's up to Disneyland Anaheim standards (I go to the Anaheim one annually). Rides and restaurants will close early without warning. Some cast members are awesome, but too many are just ambivalent (which makes the magical environment Disney tries to create impossible). Also, too many rides are closed; who closes both Pirates and Phantom Manor (their Haunted Mansion) at the same time? Everybody knows to stagger these closures. Come on man",0
12462,"We were very disappointed to not have wifi. As an International traveller we need wifi to communicate with each other or to access Disney App.We were surprised because seaworld, San Diego zoo, Universal Studios all have free wifi Another huge disappointment for us was the Character lines. Our daughters stood in line for sometime 20mins only to watch the character leave before we had a chance to take a picture. Unfortunately this happened to us a 4 or 5 times. We started to ask the character guide what the schedule was. There should be someone at the end telling people when they are leaving. ",0
30208,"What would a trip to Paris be without a trip to Disneyland. We had been looking forward to this for so long to feel some of that magic but it was just not there. We were two family   s with 4 kids aged between 2 and 14. A number of rides were closed which was disappointing and wait times for most rides were 45 60 mins. Even our pre teen kids were getting annoyed with that but how do you tell a toddler that he has to wait 45mins to get on a dumbo ride so most of the time we gave up. Even the train ride one of the stations was closed with no signage so had to walk all the way back to find a 60 min wait but closing in 30???Not that rides are the main attraction for us but there were no characters wandering around etc. We found navigating the park with the map and app difficult and many times the wifi dropped out so the wait times would not show. Even just finding a place to sit and eat was a challenge. To me it felt like one big gift shop.Am I glad we did Disneyland, yes, would I return, probably not.",0
36038,"Where to start...Many believe Disneyland is supposed one of the best parks we have in Europe. I was hoping to get reminded of the nice parks I have seen in US.Although to a certain extent this was the case, Disneyland failed to impress me.Not enough rides, the few good ones (exception made for the awesome Star Wars ride) were overcrowded (90 mins queue). There is a system to 'book' your ride. You can basically pass the ticket and the system will give you a time to come back and be fast tracked...So I used it at 1.40 pm, the ticket told me to come back at 7.30! And this was during a Thursday, when it is definitely less crowded. Result: the only adult ride I did was Star Wars!Family rides are generally more accessible (and boring, if you are an adult), but if you have kids, that might be good news. I didn't see much animation within the park either (maybe due to the hot weather?).I would probably go again in a few years, but if you don't have kids forcing you to stay there long, I suggest you take a hotel in Paris (which is a very lively city) and go to Disneyland one day, two at the most using public transport (it is very easy and cheap once you get your head around it).PS: bring water and food from home unless you want to spend a lot of money (some of the restaurants I have seen in there looked also quite bad!).",0

4529,I had gone to Disneyland with my 4 year old daughter and my husband expecting it to be a wonderful experience! But it was a rather unpleasant one!The park had shut down some popular attractions without prior notice! The lion king show was called off even the grizzly gulch rides were off a few others weren't working as well!During character meet and greet we were asked to que up and we did but I saw a lot of people were breaking the line n getting in from under the rope! I told the staff there that they shouldn't let this happen but they did nothing abt it just kept saying oh no they have been in line! I was standing for almost 45 minutes in que and the line Infront of me was getting bigger than smaller and they say nobody broke the line! I even called mr Andy who was the rad there and told him but he was quite rude too found him arrogant as he was only speaking n hardly listening so I left without any pictures with my daughters fav characters!Also at the Hollywood hotel no characters came to meet kids as is expected out of a Disney property!they had no great activities for kids and the pool they had was also shut down!We felt rather silly booking that hotel because there was nothing to do!All in all a very bad experience and I don't think I will ever come to Disneyland again!,0
36060,"Straight of the bat, lets get one thing straight, this is just a massive Disney Store with a few rides, and it is going to be one expensive visit.Food and drink are what you expect for this type of attraction, about 4 euro for a 500mil bottle of Coke or just over 3 euro for a bottle of water, ice lolly are about the same.If you factor in the exchange rate you are probably paying the same as you would at any big attraction in the UK.Be prepared to queue for a while and be jostled and to almost come to blows with our EU cousins.The rides get quite busy, waits over up to 60 minutes are quite common and if you go on a busy day the 'Fast Pass' system is practically useless as they are all allocated by lunch.The manners of a queue do seem to leave a lot of people when they come here so be prepared to stand your ground and learn a few swear words in a foreign language.I think this is an area that Disney need to address, also the flow of people as some areas can get quite bottle necked.If you are travelling with a child in a pram or buggy, from our experience it seems quite safe to leave them outside the ride when you are in the queue, but don't leave any bags.In fact if you do bring a pram, use it as a battering ram for the idiots who decide to stop and take a selfie at the worst possible place.When we were there a lot of rides and areas were shut as the were being 'renovated for our future enjoyment', this peeved me off somewhat as customers we spend a considerable amount of money to come to this place, I understand sometimes rides need shut as a maintenance issue has arisen but if you going to shut off a lot, surely the customers should be made aware prior to arrival, bit frustrating that we pay 100% of the money but only receive 80% of the service.But even though it was boiling hot, spend half my time standing in a queue, I got ripped off at every opportunity and could have quite easily started a conflict I would wholeheartedly recommend this place.When you see Sleeping Beauty's castle and watch the parade you are filled with some childlike wonder, ( I am still buzzing about getting a High 5 from Tigger!!)The Frozen sing along is superb, but nothing compared to the fireworks and laser show at closing time, I was awestruck by it.Few TipsCheck beforehand if a particular ride you wanted is open   Space Mountain, my wifes fav was shut as were quite a few others.Be prepared to walk, its a bit of a walk from the car park to the Park itself and then all the walking you do .If you go in the summer months and want to watch the parade, find a good spot on the left hand side of Main St, looking down at the castle. At that time of the day that entire side is in the shade and trust me you will be grateful for it.Try a plan your day ahead or you will end up missing out a lot.If you are staying at a Disney hotel, avail of the the Magic Hours, parks is less busy and you have more chance of getting on the big rides, also if you are at a Disney hotel, do your shopping as early in the day as possible, the shops are quieter, but they also have a free service where they send all your shopping back to your hotel.If you arrive at the park at 10.am opening time, enjoy the wait, queue for baggage check, queue to get in at ticket check and then almighty queues for main rides.Bring lots of water, it gets very hot. There are a lot of water fountains about where you can refillIf you have little kids (mine are 5 and 2) there are playgrounds in Frontierland (Little Pocahontas Village) and Adventureland to get your little darlings to run about, one way in and out fairly secure",0
36061,"Needless to say, our group (including two teens) was quite frustrated with the experience at Disneyland Paris. Perhaps we've been spoiled by the attractions at Disneyland and WDW, but we expected more. During our visit, several main attractions at the park were closed either for scheduled maintenance (how ludicrous it seems to schedule maintenance on premier attractions such as Space Mountain at the beginning of the summer season) or closed due to undetermined technical issues (as was the case with several rides, including the Rock    n    Roller Coaster). Lines at several popular rides (Thunder Mountain, Crush Coaster, Disney Railroad, Ratatouille Indianan Jones) were over an hour, and several do not offer fastpasses (and some fastpass systems weren't operational!). Shorter waits at Pirates of the Caribbean and Phantom Manor. Early morning access hours don't give guests access to any of the headline rides, better suited for the younger set. We agree with other reviewers here: we won't return until Disney invests in bringing the park up to date, improves the access to rides and schedules planned maintenance at better times.",0
6599,"If you have visited the Disney parks in America, this will be a major disappointment. For example, Main Street did indeed have storefronts on one side of the street, but the other side was a painted canvas! The main Disney Park features are there, but the quality is so poor it does not create the illusion I associate with a Disneyland experience. What was of interest to me is the park was built taking into consideration Feng Shui. If you are a Westerner visiting this park, take the time to understand this feature of the park to distract you from its shortcomings.",0
36063,"Our view of this visit to Disney Paris is impacted by previous visits to Disneyland and Disney world. That said, we had also read the recent Trip Advisor reports so our expectations were sufficiently low to allow upside. There were adults and younger teenagers in our group, so no little rides. We'd booked tickets on line, saves money and time. The good things     The park itself, you know you're in Disney   well maintained Castles, grand buildings, lawns and gardens.   The following rides were well worth their waiting time   Indiana Jones (40 min), Phantom Manor (20 min), Toy Soldier drop over at WD Studios (15 min as single riders, we all went single, as it turns out on the same ride). Disappointed in     WHERE are the characters we love !!!!! In the USA you can't help but bump into them, they're everywhere. Surely not on strike.... Even the parade was well short of characters.   Star Tours ride   fun ride but not worth the 65 minute wait  Crush's coaster and Ratatouille rides over at WD Studios both had over an hour wait.....so we didn't bother.   Same for Big Thunder mountain   70 min wait. Tip   get a fast pass for this ride as soon as you arrive.   Pirates of the Caribbean ride   expected more thrills, and some link to the movies which we loved......waited 40 minutes for something an 8 yo may consider scary. Come on Disney !  The time to ride signs at the start of a ride were good, but an update half way down the queue would help.   very few sign posts around the park means you have to pay more attention to the map. FOOD   mindful of previous reviews, we took our own, which saved both time (large queues on the day) and moneyCROWDS   big, don't know who's on holidays in Europe, but the park was seriously busy. Suggest to give Disney Paris a go when it's outside of European school holidays. ",0
15462,Not as entertaining as I thought it would be for my boys. They actually loved California Adventure though!,0
22383,"Wow, don't go during spring break. The place was overwhelmingly packed. We managed to have fun during our 4 days there, but with everything being so expensive I'm left feeling a bit ripped off. The FastPass system is ruining the parks. If you don't use it for rides like Space Mountain you will be waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes while they let in several hundred fastpassers ahead of you. It you arrive at or before opening ride Peter Pan, Matterhorn Bobsleds, or Big Thunder Mountain Railway before you ride anything else when it's busy and you'll have a short wait. Big Thunder Mountain has been redone since were were here two years ago and it rides so smooth now with lots of new features to look at including a dynamite explosion inside one of the tunnels. Our favorite rides were Pirates of the Caribbean, Splash Mountain, and Big Thunder Mountain. Food is insanely expensive inside the park and also around the park.",0
24071,"So crowded, I think its because they have to have 10 parades a day, and I bet if they elimanted the fast tracks that it wouldnt take forever to get on the rides. Just my opionion. Its sad that they have to charge 4 5.00 for a bottle of water, they make so much with admission and food and parking and whatever else, they could give us a break on something..: ",0
22366,"I was a bit disappointed with the California Disneyland.The line to get the tickets wasn't long and we were served quickly and got into the park easily and were given a map off the bat. It was great in that aspect and all the cast members were friendly and helpful. I was disappointed because there were no characters to be seen all day! We had hoped to get signatures on a scrap booking page to use as a souvenir but there was no one to get it from :(Fast pass system is wonderful. Remember to get your  First Time Visitor  button, just ask a cast member where to go. We did prefer the Disney California Adventure Park which we visited the next day.",0
36068,"When you go from florida to disneyland Paris theres just no comparison, Florida wins. I did love my time there, I love disney but there wasn't many adult rides and it was mainly for children.",0
22365,"Some people never get tired of Disneyland, which is their ultimate fun activity. I'm not a fan of the rides, but I think the park looks very old fashioned right now. Changes need to be done, because I found it quite desolating. Some rides are exclusively for very young children (Finding Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean, the jungle ride); they are slow and boring. You also wait a lot in lines. It is ideal to spend the whole day there, to get to see and try everything, including the firework show at night.I was not impressed, on the contrary.",0
8853,"This was our 3rd trip and our daughter is 8 years old, it will be our last. She has outgrown this park. The first 2 times we went, hardly anyone was there. We had ZERO waiting for the Buzz Lightyear ride. This time, too many people. You have to go when it's not a holiday.Perfect for kids 8 and under. Princesses everywhere   both little girls dressed up and the real ones. Nice, manageable park. Disneyland Hotel is great location and nice too.",0
31458,It still has some of the charm but it is miniature versus Orlando. We still had s good time and I would recommend it to anyone travelling with kids to Paris,0
36057,"What did we do at Disney. Spent a lot of time walking around and queuing. A LOT of time, in the baking heat. The kids enjoyed the attractions we got to experience, and the closing time show was stupendous. But the management seems lacking. Quite a few of the rides were closed. Others had technical faults. The food outlets (all of which are overpriced, and based on our experiences are not good) are open at random times, particularly in the morning. And where is the commercial and customer satisfaction logic in having the drinks and ice cream facilities closed in the really hot weather of the last few days? It seems Disney haven't realised yet that the weather is different in France to California or Florida, and that if you're expecting people to queue for 45 minutes (which has been the standard queue length this last three days) then leaving them exposed to hot sun or heavy rain or frost and snow without some form of cover might not be attractive.",0
36056,"Oh my, 1 3 of the rides were closed, no water or drinks to purchase without standing in 30 minute lines, water drinking fountains outside of bathrooms flowed like water was a rare resource. Half of the restaurants were closed and this was during summer when park was packed full. Rides lost their color and looked worn. Walt Disney would not approve. No advance warning so many rides and eateries would not be available. Don't go. Does not compare to Disney California  love Paris, not Disneyland Paris.",0
30201,"Had to wait almost 2 hours at check in, in 35 degree heat, with not as much as a bottle of water or an apology from anyone. Not a great start to a    magical    holiday. Prices in parks are ridiculous. Over   3 for a bottle of water is just robbery. Air conditioning in room is poor and everytime someone opened the door to your hotel building your door would click. The kids love it though so you grin and bear it.You get the impression they couldn   t care though about your opinion as they have another set of unsuspecting tourists ready to go all over again every day. Shame though as could be so much better ",0
25841,"We are... were as of tomorrow 5 year annual pass holders who travel... traveled at least 2054 round trip 5 or more times a year to visit Disneyland. Yes, you could say we were dedicated and probably a few other descriptive words... So it would take quite a bit to convince this duo and often double duo to say,  Ya, I don't think I want to do that again...  We have easily spent close to 100k there in the last 5 years... And although I'm not experienced, make no claim to be experienced, and don't currently have any Disneyland stock, I would be selling it now if I did.Oh, this last trip... where to even begin... First off Cars Land is good. Not great. Not comparable to Indiana Jones, but it is not 8 hours of wait time good with 2 successful rides during off season. It can't carry Disneyland like they think it can. People aren't getting off this ride like,  Wow! Amazing!  which you hear and see on so many other rides... Although we pretty much expected this.What we didn't expect was the other changes... Almost all the rides went down several times over the 6 days we were there. We'd stand in line, the be sent away. Go stand in another line and be sent away... People just weren't walking around with that same  Yeah, I'm in Disneyland!  look either. I could see the same opinion on most of the crowds face... It saddened me.And the food... It's not the same. I don't just mean the menus because they've changed since June, but the quality. We were ready to order Domino's to our room by day 5... The personnel... Not all the Cast Members by no means! But not just one bad apple either... Clearly there's some problems there in Anaheim and it's showing in how the employees are handling their jobs. Not to mention our new little Cast Member featured in the picture attached... It's a coach roach for those of you like myself are seeing one for the first time, just out side of Thunder Mountain...Somethings got to give. I believe (AGAIN NOT AN EXPERT!!) that Disneyland can ride out this one bad year, but I'm afraid if they don't get it figured out they'll not have the same needed numbers of returning visitors and Southern CA just can't support this park on their own. I really hope they pull this one out. I don't think it's Walt's vision...Respectfully, Once one of Disneyland Biggest Fans...",0
36053,I came here as a child and returned this year whilst I was in France. The Disneyland park has always been magical and the setting decorations are what makes it so great.However I feel it is now less magical and more about business profit. When I was younger I used to see random characters wondering around the park which was a delight to stumble upon. Now you have to queue like the rides to just meet a character which loses the magic of it all I think.Still probably great for kids but lost the magic ,0
25104,"We went the end of September thinking it was off season. We were wrong. It was a lot busier than we expected it to be. Lines for most of the big rides were well over 30  minutes. And the worst was the Halloween Party that we bought seperate tickets for. We were there opening night and it was so packed strollers were literally back to back in the park. We were not able to move very fast because of the crowds therefore didn't get a lot done during that event. I thought they'd sell a lesser number of tickets for the night time only event but it seems like there were 10 times more people in the park during that event than there were during the day. I didn't get to see any villains, we kept getting moved from one location to another when we were trying to find a spot to watch fireworks and needless to say, all the rides were a long wait. The Trick or Treating spots really created a major traffic jam throughout a lot of the park and it made for a frustrating night. It literally felt like they were over capacity that night. On positive notes, my 2 year old loved the park during the day and had so much fun. He loved meeting the characters and enjoyed most of the rides. I would recommend a stroller for anybody bringing kids his age though. He spent a lot of time in our double stroller that he shared with his 4 month old sister. The weather was nice during our visit. We had a portable fan running on the baby for part of the visit but it was very nice weather. ",0
4534,"Hong Kong Disneyland is not very big, it's ok for one day visit with kids but it's a bit overwhelming with mainland tour groups who skip the queues over your children for kids rides!",0
15456,"Firstly I love Disney, love it. I've been to Euro Disney and Disney world Florida and have been planning this trip over a year. Our transport got us there around 10am. I decided to book a Tuesday as figured it would be less busy than a weekend. It was packed, the queues to get in to the park were an accurate reflection on what was expected inside. We could barely move between the sea of people, I appreciate there would be a lot of strollers bit seriously people use them as weapons to get through! Every ride was almost an hour wait and we only had 8 hours in the park. Got a pass for the Indiana Jones ride which was great....until it broke down midway and we had to be rescued (after they tried for 20 minutes to fix it before getting us out). Went to splash mountain and that was also broken down. Disneyland itself is beautify the castle is smaller but still impressive and the shops are gorgeous and attention to detail amazing.My boyfriend and I are very fast normally in parks but with a pass hopper we only got on 6 rides all day. It's a struggle to do in 1 day, most of the day is spent trying to get through the crowds, in lines or stuck on roller coasters (we were also stuck on California Screamin' which was closed once we got off).",0
22376,Went mainly to ride radiator spring but never had the chance. Heard fast pass were gone by 9am such a disappointment for my boys. The line was always 60 120  mins wait. The best bet is to stay at the resort to utilize their perks. Not as huge as Disneyworld and the rides seem rather short in timing. ,0
36048,"Bought tickets to visit both parks on one day . First disappointment was that several rides were closed, inclusive of the major attraction Space Mountain 2. Why they leave maintenance for the busiest time of the year in June is an open question. Second disappointment was that all rides commentary and introductions were done in French despite probably over 50% from other parts of the world. If your from a non French speaking country, don't bother going, because you won't understand various experiences such as the ghost house and Armaggedon. The Disney Studio Park was a huge disappointment with the exception of the stunt show. I've been to Disney Studios 10 years ago and nothing has changed in 10 years despite various new Disney movie releases. Even my teenage kids said afterwards  this was really boring . Waist of time and money",0
15455,It was an amazing weekend at Disneyland with our family. It was our granddaughters first trip and her grandfathers birthday. The Disneyland park is too crowded due to the amount of yearly passes. In the future I would go during the week. That was our only disappointment.,0

8847,Went there xmas day 2011.  We had been to Disneyland LA and after reading reviews were not expecting the same in HK.  The reviews are right.  This park is mainly for the real little kids. Very clean.  Save your money and go to Ocean Park.,0

Yes, 19 attractions closed!    Totally unacceptable. How come the cam charge full tickets from costumers.

I am supposed to return in Oct. but not sure if I will or not.",0
4543,Prepaid for a 2 day ticket but was only issued a 1 day ticket at the park. Cost us 2 hours to fix at the gate on the second day with a toddler which was so cranky after waiting that long in the rain. Not what you want when traveling on a short trip. They did offer a fast pass onto all the rides which was then rejected by all the park attendants once we were inside so we spent even longer messing around once in the park. Sent emails upon our return and also got no responses. Disappointing with the organization and service but the park is a good size for a 1 or 2 day visit.,0

For it to take all of our savings and extra financing just to go there..... and to drive 23 hours      ...it was horrible my kids were very sad...     .it was so busy we could not ride any rides...people were running in to us knocking my daughter over.....we could not see any of the shows or parades people were crowded everywhere... workers were very rude about standing were you could try to see...i guess it was a reserved spot, ....go figure........ just a heads up dont go durring a holiday they ruined our Christmas. .... I will never go again durring a holiday!!!!!! I also notified the   customer relations desk   of the   problems we were having they said next time dont plan durring a holiday .....well I kind of figured that much...they were no help at all....I rate this theme park very low... wish my family could have had fun for christmas...like all the commercials...it is supposed to be the happiest place on earth.. well not for us my kids they were very sad.....lines were like 3 to 4 hours long....we even paid extra for the park hopper tickets both parks were the same.....I guess that a theme park that large wont care about losing business for a family of 4 when they have so much business already..... I think thats wrong.. I have also notified the resort and no response. ..so I thought I would give everyone a heads up and tell our experience with the parks....",0
36003,"As a huge Disney World fan who has visited the parks in Florida close to 20 times, this visit to Disneyland in Paris was a letdown. Upon arrival at the park we couldn't believe we were there because there was NO welcome. No music, no staff, no ANYTHING   just an ornate entrance with lines inside for tickets. Same thing when passing through onto Main Street   no magic! No greeters, no entertainment. We found the board with listed wait times but no information on fast passes and no staff person to ask.The park itself was clean but the bathrooms were messy. Quick food choices are dismal   Magnum ice cream pops? Quiet walks between attractions, without any street entertainment or cast members to assist guests. You could have been at any amusement park!

30221,"My boys  8 and 11 years old  have been to Universal Studios in LA, Legoland in San Diego and Singapore but never Disneyland. We thought Disneyland Paris would be the best amusement park given the history and brand name. We were quite disappointed that many of the  Big Thrills  rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor, Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and RC racer were closed. There were 4  Big Thrills  rides at Disneyland and half of them were closed. The situation was the same with Walt Disney Studios. Disneyland Paris management didn't communicate that many of the  Big Thrill  rides were closed in the guide nor in the app. The app also did not communicate the correct wait time. We waited for over an hour plus for the Toy Solider Parachute Drop but the app said 15 minutes. The good things about the park were easy to get to via RER A and fast past. Anyways, Disneyland management could do better in communication and offering discounts when many of the rides were closed.

Be aware that Disney studios closes at 19:00. ,0
35953,"First off, the visit was enjoyable overall. Would I do it again? No, probably save a little longer and go to the  real  Disney in the USA. I have to say that one of the most disappointing things of all was the staff. Not only were they not helpful, they were generally uninterested and miserable   not really fitting with the 'magic' of Disney. For example, you would expect staff to be able to point you in the direction of certain hotels or restaurants, but most didn't seem to have a clue and sent us round in circles.I think this is the ideal place to come if you have little ones (less than 5 yrs) and don't want to do the transatlantic thing   but just be mindful it is more of an amusement park for kids than it is 'DisneyLAND'. 2 rides broke down with us on them, and 1 broke down whilst we were in the queue. In need of some maintenance I think!!The review above is for the parks, and not for the staff of the hotels or restaurants who were polite, helpful etc.",0

35960,"Had a 5 day holiday here and personally I would have given it 1 star but rest of family said two. Stayed in a Disney hotel which was clean and basically a place to sleep. The park itself had quite a few rides not on from space mountain, nautilas, merry go round, flying carpets, etc. However this alone was not the only problem. The queuing system at this park is atrocious. All systems which involve queuing will have issues but the method at this park is very bad. Some rides have fast pass but a lot of the time you couldn't get them because the machines were off. And of those rides that didn't have fast pass people still managed to queue jump as they used what is meant to be a disabled facility to do so. Disney has also issued passes to  cast  which was a big gripe, from the guy and his daughter riding autoptia 4 times alone while we were in the queue, to the 2 women who thought that because they had such a pass to queue jump at the ice cream counter where not only had everyone queued for over half an hour but that they found it acceptable to do so to a child of about 7 in front of us with no feeling of embarrassment. I first became aware of these cards when a family of 4 jumped the queue at the best hot dog place if you know how long you have to wait there to get to the front to be usurped by someone saying they have a disabled card when its a cast card and that they are as healthy as anything it's frustrating to say the least, I don't disagree with the disabled part of it,because I think that's great that they accommodate this,it's the misuse of this system which is extremely prevelant at this park that I object to because this causes the queuing of everyone else to be longer than necessary, and having to view it so blatantly is what upsets the paying customer. Furthermore we didn't use it but feel for those wishing to visit princess pavilion as you have to queue for reservations to see them, as hotel guests we were in the park early but if you are visiting for the day the chances of getting one are unlikely as by 11 there always seemed to be none left. There were other things that let this park down but the queuing was the main problem. The parade and fireworks display were about the best thing and most staff were pleasantpleasant, however when they speak not only in French but in other languages many seem to think that they have to do it in as little time as possible that you have no idea what they have said. All in all family agreed that they wouldn't go back",0

There were also a lot of rides shut down in February   some scheduled (like splash mountain) but others were just broken down (Indiana Jones). And some are being reworked for new rides.

While I appreciate the rides have to be maintained surely the price should reflect the fact that you will not get full enjoyment from the park. On the Saturday when we took advantage of the early opening for hotel guests, we noticed the teacup ride was operational. Obviously the single day guests are more important than hotel residents. On the Sunday we went on the Buzz Lightyear attraction. As it was quiet we went to go again to find it had broken down. This was the theme of this theme park, if it goes, break it.",0

The passes are dispersed and  sold out  at the beginning of the day, and the returns allow too many people to use fast pass. This makes the wait times even longer.Hoping that this is our last Disney trip.",0
35947,"First off, everyone knows that Paris is expensive, especially Disneyland, I know. Still, I went there, thinking that I get what I pay for. Unfortunately I can't really say that...We went there for 2 days, with access to both parks.My daughter (6 years) really enjoyed the rides that were open (really didn't care much for the ones that weren't   I don't think she noticed). Since a lot of rides were closed, however, the waiting lines for the open ones were something like 2 hours. For a 4 minute ride.. That taken into account, the days spent were more waiting in line than having fun. If you count the hours of waiting, you can take about 5 rides, if you spent all day, ALL day. The Disney dresses that you get at Toys R Us (exact same one) for about 30    , they charge you 80     here. And you have no chance to pass them, they are every step you go. My 6 year old daughter, of cooourse, wanted to feel like Elsa. First stop, I said no. 5th stop..... What is a mom to do?Since we stayed over New Years we watched the fireworks... And again, I gotta say that I expected more. It was short lived and nothing special really....For my next Disneytrip, I'd probably save up some more money and go to the real deal in Florida. PS: Smokers beware: There is no chance to buy a pack anywhere in this huge place so you better make sure you have enough to handle your children all day ; )",0
4604,You don't have to worry too much if you go there with young kids: they should be busy for all the time they are in the park.However this is not a huge Disneyland park with tons of attractions. Still it is worth a visit.During the winter season it does not seem to be packed at all so you won't wait too long before enjoying attractions.In short it's good fun but in my view it is not as special as the other Disneyland parks in the US or in France.,0

Thursday the 14th of September as our day to visit only to find Space Mountain and the Haunted mansion were closed (for halloween make overs presumably so they could make and extra buck off of the annual pass holders and screw the once in a lifetimers) and Indianna Jones was closed for refurbishment....3 Etickets closed.... 3.... did I get a discount, no? Was I warned when buying my tickets... no? Was I compensated in anyway???? no!I found out on the gate.... when it was too late.Simply not good enough Disney.... simply not good enough.TDA normally puts TDO to shame but they let me and every other guest that day down... turning Disneyland into a half day park!",0
33211,"I would really have loved to join the others who have given the park a 5 star review, but in all honesty could not bring myself to do it.We visited in September 2016 for 3 days with our 3 year old granddaughter. In all fairness I think she loved it, in particular the afternoon parade which we had to watch 3 days in a row.So why only 3 stars on the review?The first thing we noticed on checking the official Disney app for queue times was just how much of the park was closed. I could understand if one ride was closed at a time for refurbishment, but whole areas were closed and the number of attractions not open ran into double figures. This even included the Star Wars ride which is currently being advertised on British tv!We purchased tickets shortly before our visit through Disney and there was no mention of this. To charge full price while so much of the park is unavailable is just not right. I would encourage you to do your homework before booking to see if this is likely to happen on your visit.As if this wasn't bad enough the reliability of the remaining rides was not great. Our first 3 attempts to get on Pirates of the Caribbean failed as the ride had technical issues. Most of the fast pass machines were closed much of the time, which is a problem when you have a 3 year old who doesn't want to queue for hours.The maintenance of the park and attractions could have been improved. As well as the problems with the rides we were surprised to find workmen painting the lampposts and railings during the day (although it did amuse us watching a bloke trying to paint a tall lamppost without a ladder while people were sitting around him waiting for the parade).One of the biggest disappointments was the organisation of the meetings with the Characters. They are few and far between and have designated times and positions resulting again in massive queues. The American system where they tend to appear around the park is much better.We tried to visit the Princess Pavillion on a few occasions. Not staying in a Disney hotel the earliest we could get there was 10am, at which time the queue was over 3 hours long. It did fall to 2 hours at some times, and this was at a relatively quiet time.In all fairness I should mention that the Micky Mouse house was very well thought out and moved people through at a good rate.Maybe it's just us but the biggest annoyance was the attitude of a small percentage of the visitors and the unwillingness of the staff to enforce the basic rules.There are designated smoking areas but apparently you can extend these even as far as the queue to the Snow White ride and nobody will bother.I don't think we waited in one queue where nobody pushed past. I hate to apply stereotypes to our continental friends but some of them seem to see a queue as a challenge. If you have a small child it is seen as a sign of weakness which allows a gap through which someone else can push their own family.The usual technique if you want to try it out is to shout into your phone while waving at a non existent family member further down the queue. Do this while shoving other people's children out of the way and you will be on the ride in no time.Never fails.Oddly the staff on the rides seem to accept this as the norm.Odd really as we asked one of the Princess Pavillion staff if it was ok for one of us to queue for an hour while the others went off for a few less popular rides and then pushed through the queue. We were told that this was strictly forbidden (but then what else were they going to say).If you get to the parade route early bear in mind that a few minutes before the parade starts you will be told that your feet can not overhang the kerb. If you are sitting on the edge of the kerb you will not be able to move backwards due to the people behind you, so you will be forced to stand. You will then spend the parade feeling bad about standing in front of the children behind you, so you will let them through only to find that their parents happily follow them.You need to wait sitting back from the kerb, only to have people trying to take up the 4 inch gap you have left in front of you.You really need to be very easy going to visit this park.If rude people are a bugbear of yours you are going to have a difficult time enjoying your visit.Having been fortunate enough to have visited the Disney parks in the USA I was surprised at how unenthusiastic the staff here were. None were rude or unhelpful (and some were brilliant with our granddaughter) but most gave the impression that it was just another job.By this point I am sure that you think I am a right miserable sod just picking fault. You might be right, but at the end of the day Disney charge top price for everything. As a result of this I expect a top class experience and unfortunately they did not deliver.To end on a positive note.Even after all the above, the look on my granddaughters face when Eeyore stopped in the parade and gave her a cuddle for so long that one of the dancers had to come back and get him was worth every penny the whole trip cost......",0
30246,"Been to Disney many times in the US and here in a Paris. Hugely disappointed on this occasion, lots of major rides closed for long term maintenance, pirates of the Caribbean, rocking rollercoaster, phantom Manor, mad hatter tea cups to name just a few. This obviously has a huge impact on the Queuing times of the remaining rides, and given that this park does not operate the US online fast pass system it means you will be very stretched to complete the remainder of the rides. Obviously very expensive for us Brits since the brexit exchange rate turmoil but that   s our problem but....entry pricing should reflect the availability of the rides ! My advice would be to delay your visit until the park is up and running like something approaching normal operations otherwise you will likely be disappointed.",0
22437,"Well we were disappointed with Disneyland cost us $92.00 each. I know it is the original park but it is really showing it's years. Went for breakfast when we arrived bacon eggs  toast total over $30.00 US. yikes!!!! Four rides we went on stopped while on them. It's a Small world is under renovation (wish the person we bought tickets from would have mentioned that even though we did see it on the program after) the Mountain Railroad was closed for a  private party .... and so it goes. The staff were great, the streets are clean.. it is very Disney high end shows etc.. but compared to Disney in Florida... needs updates. I wouldn't go back.",0
4610,We had an enjoyable day there. But we're disappointed as space mountain and winnie the pooh were under maintenance. Most of the rides are for younger children so we were really looking foward to the space mountain. Oh well...we did have fun at the end of the day. Do not miss the fireworks. It was amazing. I would appreciate if the shops were to close a little later. We did not have time to shop as we were trying to cover as much as we can in the park. So the best time to shop would be after the fireworks.,0

33212,There are some downsides to this theme park which makes it a poor relation to its American cousin. The weather in Paris is naturally changeable as with much of Europe. There is nowhere to sit down and shelter from the rain. There's plenty of benches but nothing under cover. There is virtually no vegetarian food of any kind and what there is available is extortionately priced! The characters were excellent as were the shows and the rides that were open. ,0
35937,"We traveled with our two kids, 5 and 7years old. We knew that it would be a lot of lines to wait in so that was not a problem but there was no Disney caracters in the park at all. The 5 year old was so eager to hug Donald Duck and meet the Frost caracters we had read so much about in the broschyr. The princesses costed extra money to visit and you had to arrange it in the morning or it was full and she had no time to see us. If you go here, read the program of the day and find out as much as possible one day before. Also buy you tickets online at least one day before. We did and they cos 50    per person.",0
35936,Perhaps for families with younger children it would be better. I was in Disneyland CA before; I think there was better experience. Here some attractions were closed and couldn't be used. The shops were much more than required. Totally in comparison with it's price (75 Euros for 1 park) it doesn't worth. ,0
31448,"We had an easy journey from Kings Cross to Marne la Valee. The security was thorough and made us feel very safe. We stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel, thus allowing us to take advantage of 'magic hours' from 8am   10am. During this period, only Disneyland hotel guests may use the park. In one day, we enjoyed 6 rides (4 during magic hours and 2 with a fast pass). The Peter Pan ride was charming and imaginative   traditional Disney. So too was Small World. Buzz Lightyear was fun and I highly recommend the Mickey and the Magician show in the Walt Disney Studios   it was a lavish West End standard show which the whole family would love.This was the 25th anniversary year but large sections were closed off and there were long queues everywhere. Our express breakfast vouchers (offering a croissant, pain au chocolat, omelette burger, orange juice or hot drink) stated they were valid in 3 restaurants, but we were informed that only one restaurant (next to the Buzz Lightyear ride) was opened. We had to walk 10 minutes to the other side of the park. 6 tills were opened, all doing fast food and the same range of drinks, but we were restricted to the last 3 tills. It took half an hour to get our breakfast. The omelette burger (with egg and bacon) was ok but there were no veggie options till after 11am. Food options all over the resort are greasy and toxic. Fortunately the Star Wars themed seating area was spacious and imaginatively laid out like a lunar landscape   this cheered me up a bit.Several rides were functional, charmless and unimaginative e.g. Teacups and carousel. The atmosphere that I'd found on visits to US theme parks was lacking. I got the sense that the Disney charm found in US theme parks was being downplayed to cater to more 'sophisticated' French tastes. It gave the park a drab atmosphere   functional and mundane.During these summer holidays my family have visited Drayton Manor (inc Thomas Land and amazing zoo) theme park and CBeebies land at Alton Towers. We stayed at the child friendly resort hotels in both cases and had a wonderful experience at both. Both places had manageable queues for small children, an excellent variety of food, plenty of staff to help you and short distances between rides.I'd strongly recommend visiting the UK resorts. I can't understand why Disney didn't choose Spain (better weather and food and more child friendly).The Disney magic has been subdued in 'stylish' Paris.",0
35934,My day spent here was just terrible. I just don't understand what the deal is. There are really long lines to every attraction and every restaurant. Why not replace all the millions of stores which all sell the same thing with some restaurants? Not even my 7 year old enjoyed herself. Never ever coming back and warning all my friends about it,0
6585,"Many say that this Disneyland sucks because it is so small and has no rides. While it may not have as many rides as other Disneys, there is still enough to do here to occupy a whole day. It really did feel like we were in a different world once we entered the park.Recommended attractions are Space Mountain, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point. Also, shoutout to the performers of the Festival of the Lion King   a few of these singers were truly fantastic.Drawback: Quite annoying how they inspect your bags purses before entrance to confiscate your water and food, so that you are forced to buy the overpriced food and beverages inside the park.Tip: If possible, go on a weekday   all the lineups were under 5 minutes, even for the popular rides. Weekends are a different story.",0
13998,"I was in Anaheim for a day (10am   7pm) and thought I would check it out since I love Disney so much. The food, drinks and souvenirs are definitely not worth the price they are charging.

15423,"Had a good time, but I will not recommend it for adults unless you are a Disney fan. Most attractions are outdated, even with the  remodeling . I guess they put a fresh coat of paint and change from technicolor to HD, because most stuff looks old. There are a few good things, but not worth paying a hole day for 2 3 attractions. ",0
4588,"Hong Kong Disneyland shouldn't really be advertised as Disneyland haha. It's super small and while it is very cute, it was just a little sad.

Just kinda strange experience. You can't go into the castle, no Peter Pan ride!

12463,"Heaven: The original Disney rides like Teacups and Small World: whimsical and sweet imagination; true artistry from the mind of Walt Disney. Hokey to some people but enchanting for younger children and adults too. So neat to see kids' eyes light up with the sheer silliness of it all. The character actors, princesses and heroes: These Disney employees really play the part and take pics with lines of children and still manage to make happy experiences for kids and families. Prepare your child to wait patiently. Bring an autograph book and pen. You don't have to buy there; bring from home. The night parade: Big floats with thousands of lights, music and characters. Disney takes the basic parade idea and multiplies it by a hundred. However, this is the most uncomfortably crowded time that we experienced there. Fireworks every night around 9:30. Tip: the fireworks are pretty substantial; you can see them from blocks away. If you don't want to be packed like sardines, you can stand or sit outside the park in the big plaza just outside the admission gates near downtown Disney and see them perfectly fine.  The greenery and landscaping: Yes, a detail but lovely nonetheless. The topiaries in fantasyland; trees shaped like an elephant, a horse, elephant. So charming. The greenery in Bugs World. Long lush greenery representing the point of view of a bug. The jungle greenery along the jungle cruise. A lot of areas in Disneyland are very open and sun baked, but there are a few green, lush, beautifully maintained greenscapes that are pretty. California Adventure Park: the partner park to Disneyland. Loved the art deco theme on the main street. The Frozen show at the theatre was great and air conditioned. This park was about 30% less crowded than Disneyland and had tons of great rides plus all the Disney characters make appearances there as well.Hell: A lot of walking, plus more walking. The July mid day heat is not the best time for families with children to walk for hours. Plan your excursion. Duck into the little movie theatres, restaurants and shops for regular doses of air conditioning. Also, plan rest breaks in shady areas. With kids, take a 5 minute break every 45 minutes or so. Sit, drink some water and re charge. Crowds, sometimes dangerous levels: Evening around 9pm was intensely crowded. They dim the lights in the park to prepare for the parade. Not a safe feeling moving through a crowd with a stroller, in the dark. Staff help direct with lighted batons, but still an uncomfortable experience. Ride Line Ups  What to add on this topic? They're a drag. Fastpasses are good and bad. You have to come back at a designated time  often hours later. You then have to plan your schedule around this one ride. You cannot get fast passes for multiple rides just one ride at a time. We found that for some rides it was easier to not bother with the fastpass at all. Sometimes just walking back to a ride area 10 minutes later will surprise you with a shorter line. Ear piercing noise on some rides: Shattering people's eardrums does not add to the thrill of the experience. This is not really an issue with the little kids rides but some of the older kids rides have noise levels that are ridiculously high.",0
30223,It   s Disneyland. kids love it. Enjoyed the rides. We had one big problem. We went there for our daughter birthday and we made a reservation to have lunch with the Disney princesses. When we went to check in at the restaurant there was no reservation (we called three times in two weeks to make sure the reservation was done and specifically made sure it was for the princesses lunch). Of course they made it for the Disney characters lunch which is outside the Park. We had a really bad time at the restaurant check in counter. In the end after one hour of arguing and calling customer service we ended up having lunch at the other restaurant. Kids needed to eat and every other restaurant was packed. We didn   t receive any compensation or were granted anything in return for the bad moment we went through for a mistake we didn   t make,0
35998,"Lovely park but people who smoke are smoking freely throughout the resort instead of using the designated areas. Cigarette butts are all over the park floors!! Disgusting. Disney is supposed to be smoke free isn't it ??????? When we questioned a member of staff about this he had a bad couldn't care less attitude. When we visited in June 2015, there were quite a few rides closed for maintenance or broken and what baffled us was why were cafes, drinks trailers, ice cream carts closed throughout the park and why were shows closed Monday to Friday ??",0
30224,"I am embarrassed that Disney paris is affiliated with American Disney parks. We had a brochure from our hotel for a rate 20 some euros cheaper than a days pass, but was told this rate can only be used online and you have to wait 24 hours to use the pass once bought...so we had no choice than to pay gate prices only to find more than 1 2 of attractions for adults closed for refurbishing! we were done with the entire park withen 3 hours! I went to guest relations to complain, they wouldn't extend free admission for the other park that same day but for the next day, we were leaving, they don't offer refunds of any kind, nor would they extend a disney gift card we could use in the USA but they offered us 4 soft drinks...for over 250 euros spent it was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I would stay away unless you have small children that will enjoy playing in the playground areas and the maze and small rides.",0
4571,"If your a Disney Dork you will appreciate park and its twist on Disney. The park is very small, you could easily do the whole park in half a day so I wouldn't be comparing the park to California or Orlando... or even Paris. If you know your Disney Parks you know they love lining queuing you up for rides and shows. At this park while waiting to see Festival of The Lion King show there was nothing like this to keep people in line no staff and ropes as soon as the doors opened to theatre everyone was pushing and shoving (which is not in the Disney spirit).Festival of The Lion King was absolutely amazing and personally think its better then the one in Animal Kingdom in Orlando.The one thing that bugged about this park is there wasn't Walt Disney statue.Would definitely recommend it to people!

35994,"Visited Disneyland Paris for the first time and was very disappointed. The technology has not been updated from being a front runner years ago to being mediocre. The park has a few good roller coaster rides but the rest of the exhibits show virtually little innovation. Queueing at this park is also horrendous and you can spend most of your day just waiting in line. There is a fast track service but this is limited to one ride every couple of hours.Save you money and go to Florida where there is more space and more to do for a fraction of the cost.The park itself is not well maintained and is a bit tired and could do with a make over. Also, people smoke where and when they want as there as no one enforces the rules.Won't be rushing back.",0

35990,"in 1997 I was fortunate enough to visit Disney Land in Florida. A truly awesome experience. In 2015 we visited Paris. Even though technology etc. has moved on in 18 years, Paris pales into insignificant. Yes it is a good theme park and price wise compared to English ones, such as Peppa Pig World good value, but it has big faults. Number one being accessibility to Disney Princesses is disgraceful. Young girls are not interested in Goofy etc. they want the Princesses, yet the only opportunity to meet them was full for the day just 90 minutes after park opening. Lots of disappointed young girls. Instead of having two of the princesses available to meet at anyone time during the day, they should have them all. It's a once in a lifetime experience and Disneyland could easily improve this but chose not too. They don't even walk round the park, although there is a Frozen parade at frequent intervals. Very few characters are around the park, unlike our Florida experience. Having said this, the park is a good experience, if you are not going for the Princesses or to meet Disney characters and be photographed with them. Parades are excellent lots of characters there, prices are quite reasonable for a theme park due to the current good exchange rate. Lots of the Disney characters not included in the merchandise, though the Princesses are so Disney knows their popularity.",0

30231,"I have been to Disneyworld Florida a couple of times when younger. We visited the Paris park with my two kids (5 and 7) and my parents who are in their 70s,Getting to the park was easy from the hotel, 10 min private bus ride. Traffic around the park seemed fine (late June, weekdays). Entry to park was also fine, despite the necessary security checks and having to get tickets from the machine by scanning the booking on the first day.The park itself is big and gardens and layout beautiful. It's well maintained and clean, very little litter.The tickets entitle you to fastpass a couple of times a day. This is not explained very well either on the tickets or the map guides that are available at the park, or the phone app. Even the staff seemed a bit unsure how it worked. Some rides that are very popular allow you to get a special entry ticket to jump the main queue. You take your ticket to a fastpass machine near the ride entrance, it will show a time period (e.g. 13.30 14.00) and if you swipe the barcode, you'll get a fastpass ticket for that period so you can come back later. Best to use these early, as you can generally then use it again in the afternoon   it will tell you what time you can use it again on the ticket.Now the things that could be improved... 1) Unless it's midweek out of season, the park will be busy. This means even with fastpass on some rides, you're going to spend most of your time in a queue. So Disney really needs to improve the queue experience. It was sunny, and some of the queuing areas did not have shade until we progressed further. More shade would be nice.2) The park is focused around kids, but kids cannot stand easily for 45 mins to queue for a ride. They can't easily sit on most of the queue dividing barriers, and if you try to perch them on one, the staff will ask you to put them down, because of the risk I guess. I don't understand why they cannot run a small bench down the side of all the queueing, at least the permanent part closest to the ride. It would give everyone a chance to rest their legs, and would avoid the health and safety issues from trying to balance kids on the barriers.3) Kids get bored waiting for rides, even if they could sit down. You'd think Disney might have some way to amuse children, I mean, they make cartoons don't they? They spend millions building roller coasters, then make you wait standing up in the sun for the best part of an hour with no entertainment. How much would a few flatscreens with cartoons cost? Think about it, you'll spend most of the day in queues, not on a ride that lasts 3 mins.4) We waited for over an hour to have pictures taken with Minnie Mouse. It would have been same story with other characters. It's good that people get to spend a bit of time with the character and they don't hurry you through, and also they happily let you use your own cameras, and the pro photographer gives you a ticket for the photo so you don't feel pressured to buy it. Minnie went off for regular breaks, which I understand given the heat. I assume a different Minnie came out, and one is inside cooling off. But would it really be hard to have an extra Minnie over the other side of the park, maybe two or three in different places? As long as they are far enough apart you cannot see two together, the kids won't figure out. Again, this is a very cheap improvement   it's a furry suit with a plastic head.5) Food very expensive.... I expect to pay a premium for fast food inside the park of course, but it was absurd. A typical fastfood chain in a major european city might cost 6 7 EUR for a mean, here you're looking at 17 EUR for a burger, chips and drink. I think that's not reasonable. Even kids menu was 15 EUR.6) We just squeezed into the new Marvel superheroes feature. Initially they said was full, but couple of people came out. They really need to try to control the queue a bit more, as would be very disappointing to line up and not get in. Better to have a few empty seats to fill at the end. The show started and the curtain got stuck so we could only see Iron Man's legs. Then recorded announcement there was a problem, few minutes later one telling us the feature was broken and we all had to leave. We hadn't waited long, but some had queued for nearly an hour. There should be some way to give them priority access in future or do something for the kids to not feel so upset.Overall we had a good time and happy memories. But it seems there are improvements that would be really cheap and simple to make (better queueing, more characters available in different parts of park) which would make the experience so much better. This is true of most theme parks, and really don't know why none have thought to do this.",0
22410,"Based on our visit the last weekend of winter it appeared that the vast majority of visitors to Disneyland are annual passholders and locals who grew up with this legendary venue as their backyard playground. They aren't reading this and Disneyland is review proof for them. The rest of us tourists and newbies may have a different view. As someone who has been visiting Walt Disney World in Florida on an occasional basis since its opening in the 70's I had different expectations of Disneyland. I appreciate the history of Uncle Walt's creation but compared with my experiences at WDW I was inevitably disappointed not just by the relatively small real estate to cover but the generally subpar condition of many of the rides and the worn facades of the attractions. Sleeping Beauty's Castle is a little sister compared to her younger sibling, Cinderella's Caste at WDW, where you can dine and meet characters within her walls. The Jedi Training Academy here is in an awkward location with inadequate room for the families of the little Padawans sharing as it does outdoor patio space with the main restaurant in that part of the park, and Tomorrowland as a whole is a huge disappointment. Toontown was fun for our seven year olds but should have been replaced razed a decade ago. And the meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from Frozen was crammed into what appeared to be a large closet previously used for storage. Even though we arrived well before the advertised opening time our wait was two hours. For those arriving in the afternoon it was twice that.Smaller also means severe overcrowding and long lines, especially as the day wears on and the local passholders start making their way in. The FastPass system is better than the alternative, but now that the MagicPlus wristbands of WDW are up and running Disneyland should be next. Since the left coast Disney Parks and hotel staff seem to think they're untouchable I'm not holding my breath. And little enterprisers could be seen gobbling up FastPasses 50 at a time while a couple of their 12 year old lookouts kept their eyes peeled for security. Then they hustled off, no doubt to sell them later to the suckers who couldn't get their own because they were  sold out .Based on the lack of dining options relative to the number of visitors, this venue is a difficult place to visit, and even more so on a hot or rainy day where little is offered by way of shelter. Yes, admission is expensive for the non passholder but imagine how much more crowded it would be with a lower fee to get in. Then there's the generally beaten down attitude of the  cast members , many of whom could be heard talking about their personal problems and their frustrations with their jobs. I overheard one fellow talking about a job interview he just had completed which would allow him to quit. He sounded hopeful. My only hope was that these  cast members  could have held up their end of the bargain and waited until customers were out of earshot to complain about their jobs, which can be disappointing to those of us who buy into the  magic  of Disneyland being the happiest place on earth.So, for this lifelong Disney fan who now has young children, this was a must see. But for us it's one and done. It just isn't worth the expense given all the ride shutdowns midday, the planned closures for overdue maintenance, and the lack of facilities for young children. From now on, we're going (back) to Disney World!",0
22411,"I bought a few annual passes for my kid thinking about the experience I had 10 years ago.I used to take my daughter to Disneyland for 3 4 years with annual passes and it was very nice.However, many things have changed. The good 1. My kid still likes going to Disneyland.2. It is a safe place. The bad 1. The price is very expensive.(I believe $92 for a single day visit.)  The food price inside the Park is also very expensive.2. It is very crowded. It is packed with people. The wait for a ride is very long.  Maybe because it is during the spring break season. The ugly 1. The attitude of many employees is almost beaurocratic that you are one of many who just come and go. I had to show my ID 4 or 5 times because it was not updated  for 3 days after my face shot was taken. They could take the picture of you when you  purchase the pass but they wanted to save a few seconds of their time. I had to wait  in line to have my picture taken twice. 2. The management turned the Park into a money making machine. The food price is  very expensive and poor in quality inside the Park.My recommendation is to avoid peak seasons and weekends if you have to visit here and have meals before you come to the Park or bring your food to a picnic area just outside the Park.(You can get your hand stamped and come back after your visi to the picnic area.)",0
4578,"Disneyland Hong Kong was the only Disney park I've been to so far. For the most part, it was a great experience and it is a lot of fun, although one has high expectations for Disney Land and I feel this one has some shortcomings. The castle appears to be a giant cardboard cutout for example. Cardboard cutouts are not magical. I still recommend going.",0
4580,We went there in rainy day so it wasn't crowded and most of the shows was cancelled it was really small and the crew was rude not helpful and not flexible with young children i will not go there again other Disneyland much more better,0
35979,Took family to Disneyland Paris and gave it a good rating because for July the longest line was 45 mins others were 10. That said it's a smaller park and felt it was geared more for our 4yr old then 11 yr old. Prob would have given it a four star but several rides were closed for renovation and thought it odd to have so many closed at once. Would I go back... Yes but there are things to understand. This isn't the U.S. and you won't see employees at entrance to ride but more likely standing around at the exit of the line. Big thunder was better then Disney worlds as you go underground to an island as part of ride. Pirates ride longer as well. Peter Pan wasn't good. It's a good change from Disney world treated it like you would a Disney cruise and it's good. Again not thrilled with all the rides shut down so check before you go. About 1 hour train ride from center of Paris on RER A line ... It's red on metro map. About 8 euros round trip for RER train per person plus metro fare.,0
35978,"I am very sorry to say that our family visit to Disneyland Paris Park was terrible. It is not even high season, and the wait time for rides was longer the 45mins on every single ride. Main attractions where closed without prior warning. We only saw two Disney Characters the whole day. Food and drink was poor and over priced. If you have a visit planned be prepared for disappointment and it may not be as bad as you expect.Safe your money and go to Florid for a much better experience : (",0
13094,Disneyland did have Easter egg hunt still going as they had not sold out for the season. The park was at 96% capacity which made it pretty unbearable by 2 PM. We left early because you couldn't find a seat to eat and the lines for all the rides averaged an hour and half of standing.,0
30229,"Many of the attractions were closed for  refurbishment , making the lines elsewhere ridiculously long. French have no idea how to run a Disney park. Same goes for adjacent Studio Park next door. Save your money and take the kids to Le Jardin d    Acclimation instead.",0
22415,"Spent a few days at the Park with kids and grandkids March 20 and 21 (Thursday and Friday). As far as we knew it was not Spring Break, and the composition of the crowd did not suggest that schools were 'out'. But the crowds were still overwhelming. The grandkids were 5 and 7. At that age an hour (or longer) wait for most rides is burdensome and annoying. This was our 5th trip so we are not unfamiliar with some secret moves (go EARLY, get Fast Passes quickly) but we also began to rely on a couple of smartphone apps that listed wait times. Problematically the wait times were awful all over both parks after 11:00 a.m.. A couple of major rides were noted on the website as closed for renovation, but Space Mountain also closed without notice for most of a day as did the Toy Story arcade ride. The Park was unfailingly clean, the roaming musical acts were always good for a quarter hour's entertainment, and everyone was well behaved. It was the glazed eyes of the adults that suggested this is no longer the Happiest Place on Earth.",0
35974,The park has mostly rides for children. The attractions are wonderful but the queues are horrible. You get adrenaline rush in one or two rides.,0
4584,One of the smallest Disney in the world! Not many attractions. Can finish in half day.. Wouldn't really return! Tokyo USA Paris are way better,0
35972,"Visited here 4 years ago and other than food enjoyed it very much. This time brought our own food as its a rip off in the park. Paid full price for 2 adults even though travelling with my 16 year old daughter. Visited for the roller coasters but upon entering discovered Space Mountain 2 was closed as were other rides in Frontier land. Really only 2 rides to go on, Thunder Mountain and Indiana Jones. Enjoyed these but queued for over 1 hour for Indiana Ride. Great for younger kids but charging full price when all rides not available is a joke. Will not go to euro disney again.",0
25109,"We have visited Disneyland as a family numerous times over 30 years and we keep coming back for the magic. We come prepared with the expectations there will be lines and crowds. We were in DL for New Years last year   and Dec 26 27 this year. There was a noticeable difference in efficiency. a) Fast passes were SOLD out for may venues by 10:00 am.(we usually navigate and plan our day around fast passes) b) Wine Country Trattoria  we went last year and service and food was fabulous abet expensive. This year, again we made reservations well in advance were put in overflow food was still expensive but quality was woeful! No more room write   but I would suggest that it is better to limit  's with passes than water down the experience for all. Positive   Starbucks is a great addition   the restaurant it is in was excellent.",0
4586,"If you have been to Disney World in the USA or to any other Disneyland in the world, I would not recommend to visit Hong Kong Disneyland since you will basically experience the same attractions and sights.It is very well connected to the public transportation (MTR station Sunny Bay to change lines), the site is clean. But the entrance fee is rather pricey. ",0
36072,"Some of the main attractions were closed, a lot of the food outlets were closed in the evening and one even had no more sandwiches at 3pm",0
36073,Disneyland was amazing but very busy  Very disappointing when it came to rides had to wait 3 hours in line and it was a very hot day  So only went on one ride  I would not go again,0
12453,"If you have never been to Disneyworld, then Disneyland would be a wonderful place to visit. Having been to Disneyworld several times, it just isn't as  magical . Granted, we still enjoyed ourselves, but the park seems much smaller. Highly recommend if you've never been to a Disney themepark, but otherwise you may want to re consider. If you do go, I recommend the FastPass, and to eat at the Carnation Caf   for dinner (try the meatloaf!)",0
33170,"Was here recently , at arrival we saw signages that a few of the attractions were closed . We had two tickets for two days . We hardly spent three hours and moved out Coz there is nothing much to do if you are a teenager and above your days of taking pictures with cartoons. Apart from the thrill rides which are very limited in number there is nothing great to do apart from clicking pictures and watching animated stuff. We did not even use the tickets for the second day as travelling all the way from Paris is a task and was not worth. We checked with the staff if we can return the tickets for the second day atleast but they would not accept it so had to walk off having paid about 160 175 EUROS per ticket and spent only about 3 4 hours . Not worth. ",0
22303,"Traveled with my wife for a half day visit. We had a character breakfast on Goofy's Kitchen Restaurant and it was amazing. Lots of Disney Characters came to our table for photos, hugs and autographs. Great food in a pleasant place.I wish I would return with my son some day.",0
4452,"After an easy but very busy train ride, you will be greeted with a very long walk to the entrance, we took the train around the park first to get a look at where to explore, all you see is trees, the main ride was down for maintenance, mystic manor is fantastic ride, the rest are boring, it's all but impossible to get a photo with a character, food and souvenirs are very expensive, movie world in Brisbane Australia is so much better.",0
8888,"The magical experience started when we got on the MTR train. I was quite impressed with the Mickey shaped windows and beautiful Disney themed interior. It made me feel like I was no longer in Hong Kong! The entrance was big   just like how Disneyland should be, and there was a nice Mickey fountain for photo opportunities. As we walked along the Main Street my memories of other Disney parks came to me and I was instantly familiar with the surrounding buildings, shops and street decorations. Then someone pointed out the Castle. I looked up expecting to see a magnificent Castle but all I could see was the sky and a lot of people in front of me. Then behind all those people I saw the Castle... It was so small that we all laughed out loud, couldn't believe how pathetic it was! I was very disappointed. So to cheer myself up I decided to check the times for my favourite show   the Festival of the Lion King and then I saw that the show wasn't on! I can't remember being this disappointed in my life! We walked around the park then it was time for the Parade. Watching the Parade cheered me up a lot and reminded me how magical Disneyland is   no matter where you are! Even the fireworks were up to the high standard that Disney should be!The park is quite small so I was glad that we went on a Wednesday or we wouldn't be able to see anything through the crowd! They are expanding the park with a new land coming very soon so I will be visiting again. I hope that in the future they will re build the Castle because to me it is the centre of the magical park. It should be huge, it should make you gasp at how beautiful it is and it should be the centre of attention!",0
8889,"A good day for the young and young at heart.  Quieter than USA ... shorter queues still very much Disney.  The perade, fireworks ets, it's all still there, just a little quieter.",0
36172,"We went to Disney with our daughter and grand daughter and was so disappointed. Over 30 percent of the rides and attractions were closed for major renovations but we were not for warned or given any discount for all the missing attractions. We felt as though we had been ripped off by Disney. As if ripping the public off with the cost of the tickets isn't enough, they then charge you 4 times the cost for everything from ice cream , drinks, food and toys. A big thing worth mentioning to Disney, is why don't you move on the lucky lucky guys outside? They are an absolute nightmare and shouldn't be allowed to hassle the visitors. Saying they are outside the gate and not your problem does not cut it.. PS, Disney don't give me a standard drivel reply because you won't see me or my family again unless you refund the 30 percent entrance fee you should be doing!",0
36174,"I'm 16, I went with my mam and sister (a 4 year old). When we arrived we seen that it was extremely over populated. We bought a 4day ticket, every time we went there was massive queues for the small amount of rides it has. We bought fastpass tickets only to be told that you have to book a fastpass ticket and that all the fastpass tickets were booked for all rides on all 4 days. The shops are over priced    69.99 for Elsa dress. Barely any good rides, would recommend going to another park with better rides and it would probably have less wait time.",0
22298,"Disneyland and California Adventure are great, but way over crowded. Except in the early morning, the lines are incredibly long for all of the key rides. Latter in the day, we spent most of our time waiting in line. Even using the fastpass system, we were lucky to be able to do three major rides in an afternoon. ",0
6616,"We thought Disneyland is supposed to be one of the happiest place on earth but it is definitely not true in Hong Kong Disneyland. We encounter several rude and unhelpful staff especially in the disney shop inside disneyland. The sales staff display bad, unhelpful attitude when my wife ask him question in mandarin nicely. His attitude only improve when she eventually speak to him in English. We can feel the distinct discrimination to Chinese especially to those from mainland. But being in the service industry, this should not even happen. Having been to other Disney theme park in florida and LA, I must comment that the experience in disneyland hong kong is unexpected and disappointed. Your staff just spoilt our day. Lousy!!",0
22297,"Okay, being born and raised in California, I've visited Disneyland many times since 1978; however, this was the first time I didn't enjoy myself. Some of the better attractions (i.e. Nemo submarines, Bugs Life show, show in Car's land, etc.) were closed and the attractions that were open have not really changes in the last 20 years. I still see the same animatronics in It's a Small World, the same haunts in the Haunted Mansion, same Captain EO, etc. They take the same attractions and just change the paint for the current Disney movie. They have got to do something with the new technology available to them. I would have loved to see an updated small world! Now it wasn't all bad, they did have a new ride game in California Adventures; the Toy Story ride. It's both a ride and a game where you shoot at 3D objects and compete against the other player in your vehicle. It's a lot of fun and they should consider adding more interactive rides like this. As always, the shopping for souvenirs was great with plenty of options. BUT, were not paying $150  for tickets to shop! Come on Disneyland, step up your attraction game.",0
8892,"Just a word of caution, best to rent the strollers from Disney for HKD60 per day. We had our Bugaboo Bee stroller stolen within 10 minutes of a ride. It was parked with all other strollers in the stroller parking designated area. Sad to say security wasn't very helpful. The incident happened before 1pm. At end of day when we enquired on stroller status, staff were hopeful that our stroller was not stolen but instead mistakenly taken for the day. Anyway our 21 month old son had a great day at the park. This place is definitely a place for younger children unlike the other Disney's.",0
8893,"Pathetically small and uninspiring. Not worth the effort to visit, unless you are tired of shopping in Hong Kong.",0
36180,"Somehow lacking the magic of the other parks. The overall presentation of the park was great   the world's spread out and everything was pretty and done up. However, rides were consistently down and space mountain was closed the day we went. Unlike Orlando where you can prebook fastpasses online, this one relied on the old school method of going to the ride to book the fastpass and not being able to choose the time. No free WiFi at the park to see updated ride wait times. Not a lot of variety for food (no Turkey legs!) And what there were was quite expensive, especially for a destination aimed at younger kids. The guy serving ice cream either didn't care or was the slowest worker ever. The line was so long but he took his sweet time chatting to his colleagues in between serving. On good notes, The frozen show was good fun as was the tower of terror. The firework show at the end was the best of all the Disney lands! Overall, was ok but nothing amazing :(",0
22294,"My husband and I got married in the beginning of April in the Anaheim area. To celebrate our wedding we visited Disneyland CA. Our family was already in the park, when we arrived. When we tried to enter (and after we already paid of course) we were stopped by a Disney employee who uttered some words about a problem with my flowers. I thought maybe they are afraid of my flowers carying a disease that infects their plants? Anyways, a special guy (I call him the bringer of bad news guy, what an awful job) was called in and it turns out that the    real    problem was that we looked too much like prince and princess! Okay, pretty nice compliment, but not great when you look at the consequences. The guy said that in our wedding attire, we would be 'distracting' from the Disney show. So we weren't really supposed to go into the park. Okay... Not such a great start of the day, as we were waiting there for 15 minutes or more before we were even informed of this. And then the guy asked us if we brought extra clothes so we could change in regular attire etc. Of course we were not carrying any other clothes with us! I was looking forward to making pictures with my new husband in front of the pink castle in my nice dress and him with his suit, and I could see myself showing a picture to my future grandchildren, sitting in a scary ride with my wedding dress on and holding my flowers in the air, but no ... that was apparently not possible. So we told the guy we really wanted to go inside, so I suggested to wear a sweater over my dress and he finally agreed that we could enter the park if I wore my sweater, my scarf and if my husband was carrying my flowers. Well, it was chilly anyway, so I didn't mind wearing the sweater, because I thought it was good that we at least got to go into the park, as our family members already paid for their tickets and were waiting for us. However, it was a big disappointment that I couldn't take fun pictures with our full attire showing on the pictures. But, to us, it was more important to get into the park than to make a fuss over it.When we walked into the park, my husband and I discussed why Disneyland would have such a strange policy regarding people coming to celebrate their wedding. My husband thought that Disneyland was afraid of being sued if we would be rude to the children who actually thought we were a prince and princess. I thought it had something to do with all the ads I had seen online, where Disneyland is trying to sell wedding packages (then you have the ceremony and the party in the park), so I thought that maybe they don   t want other newlywed couples to    free ride    and be able to take pictures in the park if they don't pay for the full package? I know that in the Efteling, an amazing Dutch theme park that won several awards for being the best theme park in the world, loves having married couples taking pictures in their park. They even let newly weds in for free, because it   s like free publicity for them to see their theme park show up in happy wedding pictures. Also, in the minds of those newlyweds your park is forever linked to the greatest day in their lives. On top of that, people in the park always seem happy to see newlyweds, so it makes for a great experience for everyone, really. In Disneyland, too, people were happy for us and congratulating us. And yes, one girl came up to us and asked if we got married (she did NOT ask whether we were a prince and princess). When we said that was the case, she hugged us and then walked on.My husband had to make a business phone call and so we sat down on a bench. Then a group of about 8 Disney employees comes walking towards us. One older lady tells us that she has received complaints from customers about our behavior. She says that I had taken my sweater off and posed for pictures. She added that they caught us on camera, too. I was really taken aback. I felt really hurt that another customer would have said something like that about us, while it was not true! So unjust! So I told her that a girl did hug me, but that was because she congratulated us with our marriage, and that I never took my sweater off! The woman kept insisting that I did take my sweater off, that we had done something wrong and that we may have to leave the park. I finally said: well, show us the video then. And another employee was joking in a nice way: yes, let   s watch the video. I then suggested they take the flowers away. One other employee asked whether I didn   t want them. I said: of course I want to keep my wedding bouquet, but if I am not allowed to stay in Disneyland, then I will gladly give it up! Then I was allowed to keep it (well, my husband had to carry it still) and they backed down a little bit. When they walked off, one of the employees, a younger girl said that I looked gorgeous. That was nice, but I felt really hurt and distraught at that moment. It was mainly the older woman being mean, helped by the bringer of bad news. But the other employees were half heartedly following the older woman around (her orders, I guess), as I could see they thought it was ridiculous too. The young girl later came up to me and sort of apologized and gave us buttons that said    just married    and some fast track passes. I felt so touched by her trying to make up that all of a sudden I had to cry (and I don   t cry often). It was all the emotions of the day, and then a guest complaining and those Disney employees being so mean. My husband thinks the Disney employee might have been lying about the video images and the complaint coming from a customer, just to pressure us to say that that is what we did.Anyway, trying to get into Disneyland was a really bad part of our day. I wouldn   t recommend it. Celebrate somewhere else. Until Disneyland changes their policy.And why can only children dress up? If I want to be princess for a day, you know when you feel like dressing up and being a kid again, wouldn   t Disneyland be the place to do that? Well, apparently not    Sad. Other than that we had a great day with our family. Some of the employees, especially the photographers were funny and friendly. The rides are nice, but since I can compare to Disneyland Paris, I would say to the Europeans: don   t travel all the way to California to do the rides. They are more or less the same in Paris. And the rides for the small ones, like Snow White and Peter Pan are actually set for a speed that makes it hard to see anything or follow the story! If I remember right, the rides are set to a slower pace in Paris. Also, the Anaheim park seems more busy than the Paris park (we went on a regular weekday), but the lines were not too long (I don't think waiting 15 30 min is long). The only thing that   s definitely better in California than Paris is the weather and the prices of food and drinks are not too bad for a theme park (although Americans would probably say it is too expensive).",0
15522,"I did go as a child but I went 3 times as a parent. As your child grows older it gets less excited by all the shiny toys and flashing balloons and more interested in roller coasters. She also stopped watching most of the characters so we did not have to wait 2hrs in line to see Mickey. Over the few years crowds get bigger, lines got longer, facilities stay the same. I must admit stuff is extra nice and place is very clean considering how many people are there. It just was not designed for so many people.",0
36167,"Six of us, four adults and two children have just spent four days at the Park. This is not a cheap holiday and so we were most disappointed to find that at least six of the attractions were closed and one we were on broke down. This meant there were fewer things to see and the queueing time was made worse. The food offer is monotonous, overpriced, and again led to long waits. There were no smoking zones so people were able to light up everywhere that was not an attraction. Having said that it is all about the kids and they were happy. The attractions may not now be sophisticated enough for teenagers.",0
4454,"the park was big but my kids was not enjoy much because they are waiting much time for each play , example we wait 45 minute just to play on the car , the minimum waiting for each play 30 minute which make you feel poring.",0
36165,"Went to Disneyland Park yesterday with my 7 year old. We had an amazing time but we were somewhat disappointed at least three rides were shut (space mountain, carousel and one other), there were no crowd control at the railway station, resulting in a lot of pushing and queue cutting which upset the people who spent 20 minutes queuing up before the train arrived.Some of the staffs were shouting at the patrons to get back in the queue etc, I feel that they should try to put it across nicely even though it may be for the patrons' own safety. Be prepared to wait at least 20 50 minutes for most rides and there is only 1 fast pass allowed at any one time. I've been to 3 Disneyland so far and this is the only one that we did not really enjoy. There are too many restaurants and too few rides for the kids....",0
22304,"For a good experience, be there EARLY!! Once the general public starts appearing, it sucks. It's too crowded, little children everywhere, sometimes unsupervised. Not the best place for a couple to go out on a date at lol. If I had to go again, I'll make sure to bring my own snacks and drinks as everything is super expensive inside. Idk, not my favorite amusement park to visit : ",0
36163,"Being a Disney fan, having visited Walt Disney World, Florida, over 27 times, Disneyland Park in Paris was an extreme disappointment for the entire family and the entire Disney brand. The experience started off poorly as our attempt to obtain park tickets and information on their telephone system left us frustrated and annoyed. The recorded message was entirely in french and the voice recorded message informed us that the call would cost .15 euros minute. Failing to obtain park information, we headed directly to the park. Upon entering, our first disappointment was with the ticket agent selling the admission tickets. This individual did not have the  Disney  enthusisam and showed attitude to our general questions. No welcome to Disneyland, lackluster personality and showed zero interest of being there. Moving on into the park, we noticed a general lack of overall upkeep of the park. Litter was visible throughout the park, peeling paint on the attraction buildings, garbage cans hygienically filthy, visible litter, smelly washrooms and general lacking of overall care of the park. Employees of WDW take pride in the employment and maintaining of the Disney brand. An obvious disconnect at Disneyland Paris. Arriving mid morning, we headed to the most popular attractions. 4 out of 5 rides were mechanically not operable, employees had no idea as to how long the rides would be shut down, nor did it appear that they cared. We did manage to participate in a few rides, but certainly not worth the time and the eruros spent to enter the park. Food was below par, and consequently many individuals were eating their own lunches. If one never has the chance to visit Walt Disney World in Florida, Disneyland Paris is better than nothing, especially if you know no better. However, if you are expecting the park to operate as WDW, you will be sadly disappointed. Overall, a major disapointment and would never recommend it to the North American tourist.",0
36162,"Just back from euro Disney 6 adults and 2 kids, 11 and 2. We all had the same opinion that it was a very expensive waste of money. We paid extra to get the fast track tickets. We found these to be a waste of time and only used it once. The studio side of the parks were not even taking the fast track tickets. The 2 rides which we wanted to go on were out of order. There are numerous gift shops on every corner all selling exactly the same over priced items. We will not be returning. ",0
36161,"From the lady at the ticket counter to the ride operators, and everyone in between, no one was welcoming or friendly. It was so disappointing not to have that magical Disney experience. The staff was rude, the lines were way too long, the bathrooms were filthy, and the number of stores outnumbered the rides 10 to 1. I felt the park was one giant store just trying to get your money rather than a theme park for kids. Waiting in line for a  reservation  to meet a princess was like competing in the Hunger Games. I hardly saw any characters outside of the parade. The Walt Disney Studio was a complete waste of time. It is so small with hardly any rides and the rides they do have were an hour wait. I had two incidents at the park and when I complained to guest services they didn't bat an eye. Sad, sad, sad, that Disney cares so little for its customers. With so many wonderful theme parks in Europe, I say skip Disney and go somewhere else.",0
22305,Don't get me wrong I love Disneyland and the employees have always been awsome and kind Disneyland brings every one back to thier child hood but the last few years I've been to the park its been to over crowded to be enjoyed. If you go to Disneyland you should never miss out on the magical beautey of the park. But if you look out and just see crowdes of people and the wait for the rides being an hour or two hours just to get on a 10 to 15 minute ride. Its a shame maybe putting a daily limit of people aloud in the park would be a good idea. Just saying,0
25871,"I love Disneyland as much as the next person and have visited a few times over the year, but I must caution people to not make the same mistake as us and visit over a holiday. It was so absolutely crowded that it made it a miserable experience. Long lines, long waits, no room to move....I think it is unfair to crowd people in like that.",0
36158,"The park itself is beautiful, attention to detail is fantastic. The themed areas are extremely well done, might even be better than WDW. There was a lot of construction going on, but that is to be expected during certain times of the year   refurbishments must happen at some point. Fast Pass system works well, it's there to make your visit more enjoyable, so use it while you can. The staff are friendly and pretty much everyone speaks English if you need them to.There were quite a few ride breakdowns during the days we were at this park which can really cause a damper on your planning for the day. I've been to WDW over 15 times and have never seen so many rides been down in such a short space of time. The park is small, so if you get there at open (or are staying at a Disney hotel) you really only need 1 1 1 2 days to complete. The Dreams fireworks show at the end of the night is amazing; it's a definite must see!",0
6618,We didn't like this very much. We were so excited to be going to Disneyland and had prebooked a 2 day pass and didn't even stay for one full day. If you want to buy select Disney products   it is good (not all though). Every  shop front  was another gift shop. ,0
30154,"We visited in May, hoping it was less people. That was clearly a bad choice, it was crowded, crowded, crowded. All attractions had waiting time 45 120 min. The park should have a maximum number of visitors, it felt like a place you just want to get away from. Endless waiting time to buy food, no chill zones to relax. We rested on a small lawn, and was asked by staff to get up and keep moving. Of course it is expensive  , but that would have been OK, if the experience was good. This was just terrible. The kids was so eager to go, but Disney had got a terrible reputation in our family after this.",0
31468,"From start to finish, this place is hell! AVOID! Here's a flavour of our day... Bossy parking attendant chased after us and shouted at us when we tried to park at the end of the row instead of the middle, where he then ordered us to park. Long walk from the car park with several of the travelators not working. Surly security guard closed the bag check for no reason just as we reached the front (having queued for 15 minutes)   caused chaos as the whole queue then had to merge with the adjacent queue. Smokers everywhere ignoring the no smoking signs and no one making them stop. The breakfast vouchers we were given were only valid in one restaurant (the other one was closed even though it was peak season). They closed a third of the tills just as we arrived, no doubt just to make sure that everyone could queue that bit longer. Badly organised service meant a 30 minute wait for an 'omelette burger' and a stale croissant. Massive queues for everything, even the smaller children's rides. Several of the 'big' rides broken down for long periods of time with no explanation. A 70 minute wait in hot sunshine for one ride. Nothing, absolutely nothing, to amuse the children while you're in the queue. The FastPass tickets are a joke   if you don't get them as soon as you arrive, forget it! We tried at 11.30am and the next available ticket was for 6.30pm. Hopeless, and definitely not fast. Nearly 60 euros for four burgers and chips. Hardly a sign of any Disney characters all day. Daisy Duck and the Genie from Aladdin   not what you expect from the ads. And the worst thing of all   we'd booked for 3 days, so we knew we had to come back and do it all again! We hid our massive disappointment from the children, but even they asked why it took so long so that they'd only been on 3 rides during the whole day. In our opinion, the whole place is just one massive badly organised shopping mall selling overpriced tat. If you want to shop, eat expensive junk food or stand in hot smoky queues for hours on end, then this is the place for you. If not, give it a miss. We're NEVER EVER going back.",0
36154,"We decided to visit Disney as we were in Paris but oh my did we regret it. Tired team members, no welcoming friendly people, half of discovery land closed with the main rides as Space mountain closed. It looks extremely tired and worn out and the commerce and product pushing really takes the Mickey as every 5 meters you are invited to buy stuff. Paint is chipping and it has lost its  magic  then to top it received a food poisoning bug from the Pinocchio restaurant as they served curry sausage that was not kept at the right temperature and not cooked thoroughly. Rude people throughout the park so not to be repeated. ",0
36153,"We drove here and parked in 'B' section so quite close and there were travelators to use but then it was still quite a walk to security and then to ticket booths , good way to get people ready to sit and have a drink and a snack as soon as they arrive .The car park was not even half full the day we visited but there were still many very long queues.I didn't think the food prices were excessive considering.Leaving was a little confusing and I got lost  we seemed to be 'directed' through the 'village'   lots more shops . Some would visit again I wouldn't it left me flat and the continual roll of the same music was disheartening while waiting with a baby for mum.",0
12430,"I will start by stating that I am not really Disney fan and this was my first visit at any of their theme parks in my life since my wife really wanted to take the kids. If going into it you know you will stand in line on average of 30 to 60 minutes that would be good to know   this also includes getting food or going to the washroom. The sheer volume of people they allow in the park is overwhelming and seems like nearly every experience you need to pay extra or wait in line for long periods of time. Some of the rides are fun   Star Wars and Space Mountain as an example   and getting in with fast pass helps but basically felt like a cattle being herded all day from one line to another and every where you turn someone is trying to up sale you on something. The amount of waste this park must produce to me is also appalling   only recycling stream is for coke product and everything else goes to landfills. It is very clear they are in the business of making money and are very good at it but personally. For a family of 4 with two kids ages 4 and 6 we spent over $1,000 which is more than any one day activity I have ever spent...first time at their theme park and hope to never have to go again.",0
4462,booked via klook. food n rides r underwhelming. not much to do for an experienced traveller. though my kids were happy to enjoy it but we left before the night parade n even wasted our dinner coupons to dine out at a better place.,0
15523,Save the trip and go to Disney world instead.  This place is geared more to younger kids (under8). The few rides they had open had a lot going wait time.  Went on a Saturday.,0
24087,"We had already been to Goofy's Kitchen the day before our breakfast here. It does not measure up. The food was average. Nothing really special but everyone was happy. Now we had some lousy attitudes with some of the staff. Abraham was very rude to us when trying to sell us a group picture. We of course bought it but he was still so rude. He should not be employed by Disney as his attitude does not fit the park. The characters took over an hour to get to us. We wanted to get back to the park but waited so the kids could meet Minnie, Captain Hook ( who was sent to time out), Rafiki, Winnie the Pooh, Tigger (who was great) and the Fairy Godmother. All the characters were wonderful but just took a long time to visit our table. We saw Winnie the Pooh on the way out and his escort was just rude. He got mad at us for wanting to meet Pooh and we received attitude again. Kids should not experience such behavior while visiting any Disney Park.",0
36185,"OK, so I am a fan of rollercoasters and theme park and I have travelled to the US to visit some of the theme parks in Orlando as well as visiting some theme parks in Europe (Phantasialand, Asterix, Niglooland... to name a few recent ones). I have been able to put off a visit to the Disney franchise but since we now have young kids, I was no longer able to put it off. We had to go to Disney. Here I am, in my ignorance, thinking that Disney is like McDonalds: wherever you go it looks and tastes the same. Mistake  1: the attractions are *NOT* US size and thrill factor (Tower Of Terror is my main reference here) What you get in Paris is travelling fairground factor. What I expected was what I saw in Orlando (in what was called Universal's Islands of Adventure back than). I also excepted things to be spic and span; Disney is reputed for having the neatest parc in the world. Or so I've always been told. Now the parc is clean, the grass, trees, and all greenery is immaculate. Except for this: every single ride we went on had something faulty or out of order ond it (belts that don't work, carts that are taped off,... etc) Our friends even lined up for about 30 minutes to go on a simple ride, only to be sent away because it broke down... (they did fix it later in the day). One of the main roller coasters was closed off entirely for an hour or so in the afternoon!! Imagine how I felt.And here is what killed me: the lines stretched to sometimes over 2 hours, it was an extended holliday weekend in May. Fine. So they have a FastPass system in place (you take you ticket to a automatic machine, scan it and get a skip the line queue: max waiting time 20 mins guaranteed). Cool! But when 4 out of 5 of the fastpass ticket machines are not working, and there is a queue of 30 40 minutes to get a ticket that allows you to stand in queue for 20 mins, that's where I draw the line! This is the thing that really did it. So here is my advice: go there in winter, when there's no queues. Check the website to see which attractions are under construction maintenance (Space Mountain was announced under maintance   no discounts no refunds) and book well in advance to not pay full price (difference between 3 4 months up front and 4 weeks upfront can be 100%!) Or better: to enjoy your value for money go to any of these parks: Asterix   Phantasialand   Niglooland (best value money)   Efteling. I feel ripped off and dirty, I think I need a shower!",0
4429,Our family of 4 had a spare day and decided to go to Disneyland. We took the MTR was which easy and very fast. The park itself was fun but small. There are only 2 real rollercoaster rides. All in all we had a good day and are glade we've seen ,0
36217,"I spent 3 days visiting most of the components of the big  campus . My two daughters 8 10 were super excited about the park and the attractions, while me and my wife not so impressed. In addition several times in the two days we got  technical problems  after a long queue and it's not so easy to explain to children.The two hours opening before the others with Hotel it's not so good, as most of the attractions are not available.Overall is good, but I removed one start due to the balance between cost and quality .",0
30129,"My husband and I visited Disneyland Paris on Monday   I'm a big Disney fan and was really looking forward to seeing what the Paris park would be like! We had a fabulous day, we don't have any kids, and managing our fast pass well we were able to do everything we wanted in about 8 hours. It was a lot of fun and we loved the Hyperspace Mountain. (Skip Buz Lightyear if you don't have kids, it was boring and not worth the wait).There's definitely some improvements to be made   signage is minimal, it's really hard to find anything apart from the rides. They need more 'Disney' food. Staff engagement seems really low, we only met one cast member who smiled, the rest seemed upset to be there. I'd love it if the shopping outlets could be on the map, all the stores are rather repetitive and I spent all day looking for the Christmas shop, only to find it at 10.30pm after it was closed. The illuminations show at night is spectacular! Definitely stay for that if you can.It's really easy to get out to the park on the train, if you stay for illuminations there's still a train after it...but they close down most of the station and only have one entrance open which isn't signed. It's at the front of the building not at the side where the busses are.Overall I'd recommend going if you love Disney and have time while you're in Paris. If you've got lots on your list and can visit a US park then feel comfortable in giving it a miss.",0
30130,"I am truly so sad to be writing this, I   ll start by saying I saved for months to take my children here to this magical place it claims to be not for just children but people of all ages. We went for my daughters 9th birthday myself and my 2 children, one of 9 and one of 2. We arrived at 11am both dressed for the occasion (Disney characters) queued over 1 and half hours to get to the front of the 1st ride and be told it was closed due to technical issues to them go to a second ride and que for 35 minutes for the same thing to happen again and to be honest there was about 6 rides not running, then try and meet some characters 1st was belle 2nd was tigger to be told they are going on a break, honestly myself and my children walked and waited for hours I cried to my daughter saying how sorry I was that her birthday had ended up so bad I felt awful, there was nothing magical at all about this day. We then waited for the parade which really did cheer us up as I got us to the front and made sure they knew it was her birthday they did make a fuss as they went past but apart from this the park was way too, pure greed to let so many in took the shine off everything. I will never save so much money again and come here. I   m just so glad our hotel was amazing (Vienna dream house castle) or out holiday would of been one big flop. I really hate to write a bad review but I feel other people should know what they are going into",0
36214,We visited Disneyland Paris over the Easter so fully expected it to be busy. We arrived early as advised to find thousands already queuing. We soldiered on. We had been advised to buy the two park ticket as both could easily be done in a day. That advice was rubbish. We queued for over an hour for the first ride and over 90 minutes frontage second. We then watched a Disney parade which was actually very good and brought a smile to this haggard face. Having had enough of queuing we then decided to go to the studio park. This is a much better park but closes at 5 in April so we only had 2 hours there. A wasted ticket for sure. I have been to Disney world in Florida which did not really impress me either but the Paris park is just shambolic. I am sure it is great if you have small children and a large wallet but for adult couples...avoid it! ,0
8901,"I went to Hong Kong specifically to visit Hong Kong Disneyland with my 8 year old soon. Took the MRT from our hotel which stopped a mere 200m from the main entrance, which made the resort easily accesible. Arrived at about 11am and the crowd was already quite heavy despite it being a weekday. Entrace was fairly easy, a short queue to buy the tickets then proceed to the turnstile to enter the resort. The first part of the resort was the Main Street lined with a variety of stores selling food and souvenirs. A fairly good mix and made one feel like actually walking through a small town. The end of the street branched out to the various theme parks. Our first choice was Tomorrowland which was a lot of fun with the rollercoaster ride, Buzz Lightyear speceranger adventure (went for that 3 times) and the car ride which i forgot its name. The line was however long and had a waiting time of between 10 30 minutess.Next we went to the Smallworld which was a fairly educational slow boat ride through different countries around the world with dancing dolls displaying it's cultures. We then took a boat ride around Trazan's tree house and then another short boat ride to the treehouse. We then took in the 4 D movie (twice) which was a good one. It was not only a movie in 3 D but included scents and real water spurting on viewers. The only thing missing was motion seats which would have made it more fun.All in it was fun except that food was a problem for Muslims and we ended up a little hungry after spending 6 hours there. Not sure if the resort allows for food to be brought in as a picnic would have been a lot of fun especially in the mild weather during our visit there. I would recommend it for parents with kids between 5 11. Older kids probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.",0
22276,"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld several times. It used to be that Disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger, Florida based cousin. Now, its not even close. Disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy...especially characters dressed up everywhere. At Disneyland, we only saw two characters the entire day. The biggest difference is that because 'Land is in the middle of the same 20 million people every day, its not just a target destination for traveling families, but  frequent fliers  who are no where near as polite. At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should. As your kids get older, Disney overall isnt as much fun. There are only a couple of  thrill  rides, as compared to other amusement parks which have several.Having said all of that, the park is clean and the kids had a good time.",0
36210,"If you want a nice day out this is a good choice but do NOT expect a magical Disney experience in Paris. The staff are incredibly unfriendly   I did not meet a single friendly member of staff in the parks. The food is expensive and sub standard. Some of the rides are old and irrelevant, the characters do not circulate the parks and on the rare occasions you spot them they do not stop. I think the main difference between the real Disney (Florida) and this embarrassing excuse of an European version is the awful staff.",0
22278,"Perhaps it is due to the fact that they have split Disneyland into 2 parks, but Disneyland seemed much smaller than Disneyworld in Orlando or even Eurodisney. Staff was not overly friendly. Just ok.",0
4424,"We were quite excited to come here and getting here was super easy on the MTR underground and overground. However we sadly slightly disappointed as we were expecting more Disney characters walking around. My daughter really wanted to see the Frozen characters which were advertised on the website as being in Fanstasy land but when we got there we could see Sophia the princess working her socks off, but the Frozen sister's were nowhere to be seen. The rides are ok but nothing amazing for a 4 year old. ",0
36207,"Well where do I start? What a terrible place this is! Like hell on earth. I wouldn't go back here if you paid me. Queue, queue. Queue. Took us absolutely ages to get into the park and once we were in it was a nightmare! 90 minutes queue to see princesses, 2 hours for the teacup ride, all the cafes and restaurants here just sell burgers and pizza at absolutely ridiculous prices. Example we found McDonald's on the night we arrived, we started queuing at 7.30 pm we finally got served and started eating at 10.30pm!!!!!! 3 hours queue in a McDonald's if it wasn't for the fact I needed to feed my children I would have walked out much earlier. I bought 4 quarter pounder meals as this was pretty much all they did and a happy meal for my 2 year old and it came to   46!!!! I felt this place was awful we couldn't wait to get out of here! We visited in the February half term for 3 days, God knows how much worse it got in summer. Only good thing about it was the parades they were very pretty. If anyone's going I would suggest they go prepared with snacks etc as this place is a nightmare you should expect to queue for an hour for a drink! ",0
30133,"The park it   s self is amazing, the shows ad the parade were beautiful, and most amazing was the night show with firework over the castle. Attractions were cool, the star wars stuff was cool. It is very help full to get the    fastpass    wherever you can. The down side: the lines are crazy in the whole park, and the stuff is so unorganized. I know that they are doing their best but it was so hopeless when you see half of the ride empty ad the line is for one hour. The whole experience was nice, but in the next few years I don   t want to repeat it.",0
4426,"This is nothing like the size or scale of Disney in Florida. I went with my 11 year old son in March. The weather was great. I wouldn't want to go in the summer with rain, heat and high humidity. In each of the four or 5 sectors, there is one big ticket ride. The lines as always in Disney are long and for some of the rides, we felt that a 40 minute wait was not worth it   Winnie the Pooh ride and the Autopia ride for example. If you have a toddler, I'd avoid any rides with long lines. You can get fast track tickets which are a better option but go early and plan your rides ahead for this option to work for you. Food options are very limited with a few corn cob, hot dog, pop corn and candy floss stalls and over crowded restaurants selling mediocre Chinese and western food. Take your own. We purchased a 2 day ticket but were fed up with the heat and the crowds after a day. If you are selective about your rides, there is no need to purchase a 2 day ticket. Entry lines die down at about 2 or 3 pm.",0
30134,"Let me start off by saying  If you have never been here before you will love EuroDisney  so please don't read any further.However if you have visited before you will, like us have noticed the gradual deterioration of the place.1. When first opened the staff, who were recruited from across the globe, were proud to be there and wanted to please and were great Disney ambassadors now if you are not local you get very indifferent and sometimes downright surly service, no smiles just give us the money.2. What has happened to the Disney characters that used to walk around the park and talk to the visitors? They created the Disney Magic but now Not one to be seen in High season much to the grandchildrens dissapointment.3. Rides   still a good selection but is it two or three years now that the Pirates of The Caribbean has been closed ? And it's not the only attraction fenced off and out of action.4. General Maintenance  Main Street USA (by the shops) is immaculate but other parts of the park are in need of some TLC e.g. There is a crumbling star in the walkway up to the Studios it's been there a long while whereas in Florida or California it would have been replaced in days.4. Dual standards   on the moving walkway from the car parks you are told   No picnics and it's a non smoking park, guess what? The locals smoke and picnic inside it seems it is only the 'visitors' who obey these rules.5. Queues   Yes they are inevitable but you would think a cartoon company would have TV screens at intervals to entertain small visitors, looking at the back of Adults legs for an hour or more is vey boring.We have been several times in the last 25 years but sadly this time was probably the last and we'll cross the pond to visit proper Disney Parks in future.",0
30135,"We were super pumped about taking the kids to Disneyland as part of our Europe trip. What a let down   there were more Disney merchandise shops than rides. Many rides were closed for renovation etc., and this meant huge queues for the few rides that were operating. This obviously led to immense strain for certain rides: we queued for Big Thunder Mountain (one of the few operating rides) for an hour until it broke and closed for the day. It is all filler and no substance   seriously just merchandise, there's not much to do. My son counted 32 merchandise outlets on Disneyland map app, and on the day we visited the rides operating were the (1) Hyperspace Mountain, (2) Buzz Lightyear Blast (actually okay), (3) Orbitron (addressed up merry go round), (4) the Autopia car driving, (5) Dumbo the Flying Elephant and (6) Peter Pan, oh and the aforementioned Thunder Mountain (broke down). The Swiss Family Robinson tree house feature looked exciting but its just a walk (yes, a walk) up and down a concrete tree   no slides, swings etc.I'm not sure how you would fill two days here; possibly most of this time would be spent queuing for your lunch in the Pizzeria Belle Notte. There's nothing vaguely magical about it. Actually the magical part is how it has kept open all these years. If this were my theme park I would be ashamed. My kids (10 and 8) hated it and of the 32 day trip in Europe they ranked their visit to Disneyland Paris as the worst day.Terrible waste of money and time. So disappointing.",0
36201,"Having really wanted to go to Disneyland with my girlfriend earlier in the year with high expectations. We were disappointed with the park even though it wasn't during peak season. We came to the conclusion that Disneyland really is for kids or families. The thrilling rides were not exactly thrilling. It was mediocre for the amount of time spent waiting to get on it. The range of souvenirs were limited and the stitch keychain looked nothing like stitch. However on a positive note, Disneyland does not disappoint in terms of themes. They do go all out and that's impressive. To conclude, Disneyland is a lot more fun if you are a child. ",0
12424,"Us, a family of 5 from Texas visited on 7 20. This was my kid's (16, 14 and 12) first trip and wife and my return trip since the 80's 90's. We visited the main park (not CA adventure), and it was very crowded, with wait times of 60 mins to 90 minutes for each ride. We didn't purchase the fast pass, but from what I could see, the fast pass let you come back to the ride at a  scheduled  time to skip the long line. The  scheduled  time was an hour or so later and at least for one of the rides, the fast pass was not available for holders to use (Nemo's adventure). The day we went it was very hot and most lines were in the sun light   the fact that there were no mist cooling stations was strange (the other LA area amusement park has these). I didn't feel the rides were worth the wait times and none of us enjoyed the park. If you go to the park, skip the Nemo ride   it's faux fish and a Nemo short movie that will leave you wondering why you waited 60 minutes to see it.",0
33167,"I was worried about visiting with nearly 2yr old and was right to worry. The queues were stupid and there was no shade, so we're standing in a queue for nearly 1 hour with a 5yr old and a 1yr old in the sun with no buggy (had to leave it before we joined the queue)   absolute nightmare in my opinion. I gave up and told my hubby to take our older child on stuff and I hung around with the baby waiting on them.Most of the staff were rubbish. No customer service skills what so ever. I was waiting for some food with my baby and when it came to my turn the girl got up and started talking to one of her colleagues about her mobile phone. This went on for a good 5 mins and I walked away then she shouted me to come back. Eh no thanks!!The actual food in the place is below average and you pay a premium price as you can imagine. Quite a lot of the attractions were shut!I don't regret going, but not sure I will visit this particular one again.",0
4431,"If you have been to other Disney parks give this one a miss.  So much smaller and many of the popular rides missing.  Highlights were space mountain, river cruise and mystic house.  Always a great atmosphere, no crowds here, no queues for rides.",0
30137,"We always go back to childhood whenever we walk into the park. We love it and love the ambiance. But it is like a magical world with all expected creatures, except for the fact that the trolls and vilains are often found in the form of staffs (attraction controllers, queue organisers for photos with characters especially). They never fail to make all the magic go with their rudeness and inappropriateness and racism, and often need to be reminded to care (though they don   t care at all)Extremely disappointing from this aspectThe solution to avoid queues is to book a super expensive room or suite in Disneyland Hotel to obtain the VIP Fast Pass.",0
25878,"Just got home from a long weekend in Anaheim. Have been to Disney several times but this was not one of my favorite trips. Several rides in the park are closed for refurbishment   Indiana Jones, haunted mansion, and a large part of fantasyland. These are my two favorite rides!!!!! City hall is also under reconstruction which means giant tarps over the facade. They moved the bakery with the heavenly cinnamon rolls   it just isn't the same. The heat made everyone cranky and short tempered   including cast members. I would feel bad for anyone visiting for the first time   not the magical Disneyland experience we've come to expect. On a brighter note   California adventure was awesome!!!!!!",0
36196,"I've visited Disneyland Paris several times but this was different   some of the rides (pirates of the Caribbean) was so poorly lit it was just complete darkness as was Peter Pan   maybe they are cutting down on the electricity bills! Meet the princesses was closed by 1, space mountain and the carousel were out of action but most noticeable was the lack of staff   all the usual Disney stuff such as parade etc but it's lost some of it's 'magic'   even the two 7 year oldGirls (2nd visit for 1 and 1st for other) found it a bit lack lustre !As usual food was overpriced and basic. I think this is the last time for us   just not what it was.",0
30139,The park consists of 80% shops and restaurants and only 10% of the rides in which 15% are tours entertainment.  In all not much big rides.  Only 3 in this whole park and 3 in WD Studios,0
36194,"As we had 3 small children this park was excellent unfortunately some rides were not open which was annoying, especially for the younger children. The parade and light show were great. Not enough places to buy water so take it if possible. Shops weren't as good as in Disneyland Park. We would have expected to see characters around the park other than those where you had to line up for photos. Little disappointed for toddlers.",0
25877,"We went there on Sep 3 labor day week end. The ride was great! Racing the other car. But waiting in line with hardly any shade. No water fauctes. Also waiting in line for three hours.  Suggestions. Bring sunscreen, hats and Umbrellas.",0
36192,"As a family we left a little disappointed by our visit to DLP. The atmosphere in the park is brought down by rude people who think nothing of pushing in front of others in queues and smoking wherever they want. There also seemed to be a lot of construction work going on around the park and a few of the rides were shut. I have visited Disney World in Florida several times and have never encountered any of these problems there.On a positive note some of the rides were very good such as Thunder mountain, small world and Pirates of the Carribean. If you have younger children DLP is also more manageable to get round as its a much smaller park than Florida. Overall we managed to enjoy our holiday but think we will save for Florida next time.",0
33168,I bought tickets on the internet page of Disneyland Paris. We were terribly surprised when we visited both parks. Major attractions were under reconstruction. It was nowhere mentioned when I bought the tickets for full price. If I new this I would not fly in from the Czech Republic! This is a tricky behavior and I would not expect anything like this form Disneyland.,0
36190,"I'm writing this review in hopes that Disney monitors social media. And I hope they listen to the comments to improve. We are family of five and have been to WDW many many times as well as Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Seas in Tokyo. We love the Parks. We also enjoy Universal and I never thought I'd say this, but we find ourselves going more and more to Universal. I digress. We have several critical issues with the park. But first the positives. The park was clean and in general not as  worn  as I had read. The employees were very friendly and helpful. Ratatouille was a great ride and we all loved Crush's coaster too. The critical. Many things were closed or broken down. Restaurants all over the park closed REALLY early. And posted times of when restaurants were open until we're simply not true. And cast members and folks in city hall didn't know hours either. We tried three times to have ice cream on Main Street and every time we went they were closed. Even the popcorn carts were. Closed by 6:00 pm. Also for morning extras morning hours none of the headliner rides were open. You could ride some Fantasyland rides in the early hours but Peter Pan, which was always the longest wait wasn't open in the mornings????? The area with Casey's rail road closed at 8:00 when the park was open until 11:00 pm. We had a very hard time getting any fast passes. By mid day they were sold out and many  listed  fast pass rides had covered up kiosks and weren't giving out tickets at all. And it uses a QR code on the ticket and there were frequent observed problems with them reading the codes. If you are an XL in the U.S. Forget buying a shirt in France. Went to customer relations to get a  first time  button, and they don't have buttons in France. We hear it's their  down season (June?) but the Carousel, space mountain, 10,000 leagues ride, and cinemagic (studios) were down. One day Big Thunder broke down around 7:00 and didn't open for the remaining four hours. When you got into the park for extra morning hours, the rides were still getting ready and not openFinally food. It was REALLY expensive for any sit down restaurant. I suspect they were trying to get folks on the meal plan. Contrasting with the tourist areas of Paris that were cheaper!!and the employees were not prepared at all for somebody with a gluten allergy. That was really a hassle. In the end, if it's all you know, I can see why it's the most popular destination in Europe. But it is MILES BEHIND Orlando, which explains all the British folks that travel to Florida. ",0
30142,"The park is well maintained and clean, and most of the staff is helpful. That   s the positive side.The rest is rubbish. If you go, bring a lot of patience. You have to stand in line everywhere. If you want to have your picture taken with one of the famous Disney princesses, wait for 60 min. If you want to go on a ride, wait another 60 min. If you want something to eat, wait in line for 30 min. When we left people were taking seats waiting for the parade 45 min later. My kids (5 and 8) were very disappointed. We managed 3 rides during the 6.5 hours we spend there. I   d say the time spend was divided into 3 hours of waiting time, 1 hour of sitting down eating, 2.15 hours walking and 15 min ride. The fast pass is a joke, we got a time slot 4.5 hours later and by that time we were long gone.Don   t bother, I for sure won   t be coming back!",0
30143,"The most important thing to note is that I grew up going to Florida Disney 2 or 3 times a year. I have also been to California Disney a few times, so I cant help but compare. I feel like this trip was a waste of money in all honesty. We went in April and did the trip  on the cheap  I suppose. We took a national express coach from London to Paris overnight and it was such a time and money saver. We got to paris about 6am and the coach was comfortable enough to sleep, obviously a bit disruptive to have to get off at customs Eurotunnel but other than that, pleasant. The round trip was only   100 total for 2 people which was a total deal. The train to disney was something like 15 euros total from Gare de Lyon, which we walked to from the station. As you can imagine we got to Disney well before parks opened. The few shops restaurants there were pretty rubbish options. We had McDonalds for breakfast. When we got into the studios park, Tower of Terror and Indiana Jones were clsed for the day. Aerosmith wasn't as good as Orlando. Over at the disney park, we had an alright day, watched one parade, Space Mountain was really good actually. The Ratatouille ride was brilliant. Lunch was awful  not enough options, we wanted to eat a restaurant but only 2 were open and not good choices, so ended up having a crappy hot dog. We left the park by 4pm because the day jsut wasnt going well. Our trip to Paris in general wasn't great but honestly, if its feesable for you, save your money and go to Orlando  that is the disney that I know and love.",0
36187,"Long ques, terrible food, too exspensive, a lot of rides were closed, nothing but gift shops and unhappy looking people everywhere. It felt like nothing more then a money making racket, I was so excited about it and was very disappointed. We got tickets for both Disney land and the studios but thw studios closed at 6 which we didn't know anything about till it was too late, got about an hour in there. Rip off.",0
22311,"We travel a lot and of course this time was with our two children 8 and 3 years old. This was our 3 year olds first time to any Disney park and our son we have brought four times prior to DisneyWorld. I haven't been to Disneyland in a long time and maybe I am biased to DisneyWorld. I felt not only did the staff not have the Disney attitude like DisneyWorld some were outright rude. Maybe it was the week we were there, I am not sure but they were not the way you would expect Disney staff to act, I even heard a group of them standing around talking about their personal lives instead of interacting with guests. I expect this from other parks but never Disney. Almost all the major rides were closed so most of the attractions my daughter could go on, Small world, Ariel, etc. she was not able. There were not a lot of options for sit down restaurants in the parks either and the lines were atrocious! I will always stick with DisneyWorld from now on I was so disappointed I am such a Disney fan.",0
4465,"This is the smallest of all Disney parks worldwide. It's situated on Lantau Island, not far from the Airport and Tung Chung suburb. It looks like it is build in the middle of nowhere. The walkway leading towards the park can use a Disney Village to brighten up the area. The park itself lacks a wide variety of attractions and rides. It's adjusted to Asian prefferences which means no real thrills, mostly show and shopping. ",0
15467,"Been going to Disneyland since I was a little kid. Every year the ticket prices go up and the lines get longer. This time we were so shocked at how many rides kept going out of service all weekend. We paid over $700.00 for tickets for two adults and two kids for 2 days. After paying for parking and food and a few shirts I'm sure it cost me at least 1000.00 bucks. So many people were in the park it was hard to even walk around. Long lines for food, rides and bathrooms. Fast passes ran out quick and were not available. We spent so much time walking around trying to get on rides that were either out of service when we got there or went out of service while we were in line. Indiana jones, haunted mansion, Astro boasters, space mountain, cars, scream and big thunder railroad are just some of the rides that had technical problems and were closed off and on. Just not fun to stand in line for 40 min to have them announce  Sorry we are having technical problems and the ride is temporarily closed . No other information is given. Could be closed 5 min or 5 hours. I have never experienced this in all the years of going to Disneyland. I remember thinking as we were waiting for over 2 hours in line for the cars ride how we must all be brain washed to pay 700.00 to stand in lines all day and think it's somehow fun. Don't think we will return until they limit the number of people that are let in the park each day. Just not worth the price they are charging anymore. ",0
36099,Its was sooooo over croweded and lines were too big ...twice after standing for almost 45mins rides got cancelled due to technical problems...many rides were under renovation....hong kong disneyland is sooooo much better n managed....can be goven miss easily,0
36093,"We have just returned from 4 nights at Euro Disney, we took our children out of school hoping it would be quiet, be warned the Spanish school summer holidays started a week ago and it was absolutely packed to capacity, you could barely walk and the queues were ridiculously long, over an hour for most of the big rides. The fast pass was useless unless you managed to get one first thing in the morning, by lunch time the fast passes had either run out or the next available slot was after 6pm. When you have managed to get a fast pass you cannot get another one until you have used your first one so if your fast pass ticket is for later in the day you cannot get any others. At one point the queue to get a fast pass was over 20 minutes long!!Another disappointing thing was how miserable the staff are, this is Disneyland and they could barely break into a smile. So many rides  areas were closed, I have never seen to many green boarded up areas before.It's a small world ride was absolutely stinking dirty the floor under the water outside was green with fungus and during the ride we saw empty crisp packets and drink bottles floating around.Crowd wise I don't know how this park functions during it's peak times when it was at bursting point in June with just the Spanish school children on holiday. If you are yet to book I would highly recommend you check the European school holidays as it seems with even just the one country on holiday it makes a huge difference. On a positive note, the firework show in the night (11pm!) was fantastic, Crush's Coaster ride was fantastic but the waiting times were awful. Our two daughters loved it but unfortunately couldn't get on too many rides due to the queues. Buggy hire is 15 Euros a day, if you want to keep the buggy overnight you need to pay a refundable deposit of 70 Euros. Ice cream lollys were around 3.50 Euros.",0
30189,"There are some great things about Disneyland Paris, but there are also some downsides. We thought we would make the most of our last holiday outside school holiday time, but the parks were still very busy and the popular rides frequently had queues of 80.to 90 minutes. There were several attractions which were out of action during our visit, either for maintenance or because they broke down during the day. If this happens to you, be advised to go straight to customer services, as the attraction attendants can   t help at all, and are sometimes quite rude.In contrast to our experience at the parks in the USA, we were told off at least once a day for really petty things, e.g. my husband put his sunglasses on the top of his head as we started on the Pinocchio ride. Several attendants went out of their way to admonish people (not just us, but generally adults). This really soured our experience. Many dining options provide limited vegetarian dishes, but there are a few places where you can get something other than a cheese & tomato dish, or salad. You   re not allowed to take picnics into the parks, unsurprisingly, but you can fill up water bottles for free!",0
13988,I was shocked to see how much the entrance to Disney has increased. We visited on Sunday 30th October and opted for single day hopper passes. I was shocked to see that the price was $160 bucks each... $320 total...Thank god no kids in tow! Granted I have not visited there since 2004 but I am sure that back them a three day hopper cost me less...Trying to cram in both parks into a single day means that it is nigh on impossible to do everything which equals very poor value. On top of this some of the Disneyland staples like Splash Mountain and Its A Small World were closed. Could not get on The Tower of Terror due to120 mins line which was fairly consistent for the whole day. Oh I almost forgot if you are driving add another $18 for parking. Also when you are in you are locked into the ridiculous prices of food and drink like $4 for a bottle of water!...Talk about daylight robbery! The whole price of the thing now seems a total rip off and is disproportionate to the experience that you get once inside...The whole thing has left a sour taste so will probably not be visiting again. : (,0
12448,"Enjoyed Disney, lines were long, kids 10 and 16 a bit old for the Disney buzz. Enjoyable experience to say you've been.",0
4505,We went twice to Disneyland Hong Kong. The first was In sept. It was humid hot long queues and a nightmare with a little kid in tow. But we still had fun. Perhaps it was the magic of seeing the Disney characters come to life. The second time around the weather was so pleasant we didnt mind the waits. In fact they seemed shorter. It was less crowded perhaps because it was March and a little chilly. The shows were fantastic. The only disappointment was that we didn't see any characters for the meet and greet except for Mickey and Minnie. There was nothing from frozen which was the main reason my daughter wanted to go apart from a brief appearance in the show. Judging from the popularity of frozen u would expect a whole lot more. Overall an enjoyable experience but then again I haven't been to any other Disneyland to compare. ,0
36098,"Is money tight again at EuroDisney? We arrived at the start of the summer season when the crowd number is high, but many rides were closed and much of the park blocked by green fences surrounding mystery work, but taking away some of the magic. There was a distinct lack of characters around. A few years ago the few Disney trains that go into Disney station were always met with characters, now none. The Frozen Royal Welcome  parade  was little more than two horses, a cart and the two sisters. For this we all stood behind barriers expecting a big parade! No chance! Expect to queue longer than the times suggest. 20 mins advertised wait was regularly 30   40 mins. No sign of the  Babyswitch service . But biggest gripe was that we were staying at a Disney hotel and expected  Magic Hours  however, on entering the park early many major rides, Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion etc were closed off until 10am anyway. Not much of an effort for so called Magic Hours. Some of the rides and hotels are getting  faded  and need sprucing up. Food was good at Annettes (despite being almost hidden again by green fencing and work) and food lousy at Planet Hollywood, which seriously needs a refurbishment. On the plus side all staff we encountered were helpful and lovely although some were a few very slow in getting queues moving or serving, but no complaints on their attitudes and were one of the best assets of the Park. We had a great time but feel the Park is letting itself and its customers down in several areas and for once we are not desperate to return.",0
33189,"Having visited Disneyland Paris several times since it was opened I was looking forward to taking my two young grandsons for the first time. We were so disappointed that several of the rides that they were keen to go on were closed for refurbishment. Whilst I understand that this is necessary work I was amazed it was being done during the summer holiday season when I would have thought the park would attract lots of visitors. It certainly seemed busy whilst we were there. Add to that several rides kept breaking down and so we were unable to go on them, having got to the front of the queue on a couple of occasions. Not the experience I was hoping for, and no reply from Disney either!!!",0
15509,"I've always been a fan of Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 5 years so during a recent trip to Anaheim I couldn't wait to re visit the original park. Sadly I was disappointed; Disney California lacks the Disney magic and doesn't have the same vibe. The park felt claustrophobic and vastly over crowded due to the sheer number of people that were pouring through the gates all day long. It was difficult to walk from one area to the next as thousands of people swarmed around. After 5 hrs we only managed to go on 3 rides owing to the 1.5 hr long queues, there was a 30 minute queue for ice cream, a 30 minute queue for coffee and a 15 minute queue to use the filthy restrooms. This is far from Walt Disney's vision.",0
33188,"Honestly, having been to both this one and Disney world Florida, do not waste your money. If you want to go to Disney, save a few more pence and make the effort to go to Orlando as it is in a different league. The weather, food, rides, spectacle, service, are all so much better and more magical. It is not cheap to come here so do not waste your money when you can get so much better for not that much more!",0
30184,"Purchased a 1 day 2 park ticket, entered the park at 11am and all went well until 5pm when the rides began to close. Took the children for an ice cream where a few customers were still being served only to be told they were closing and no morecustomers would be served. So off to Disney Studios to use our 2 park tickets only to be refused entry   special event only entry at an additional fee. No where was it mentioned about rides closing from 5pm or anything about a special event taking place when we purchased the ticket   did they care not one bit. Totally different attitude to that in Florida",0
36103,A smaller version of the Anaheim California father but not quite up to Disney's standard. Not many rides and a self play options. I've visited their other properties and this is probably their weakest offering,0
36104,"Having never been to a Disneyland park we decided to try a day at Eurodisney with our 7 year old. While she enjoyed the day and we spent 10 hours in the park, she confessed in the car on the way home that she preferred Chessington (she is a bit of an adrenaline junkie!) The park does look tired and in need of some TLC. It also needs some signage! I wondered if this is a ploy to get you walking around aimlessly looking for rides, hence not getting on many of them! Noone explained about the parade until we asked why the park seemed quieter at 530! The queues on a Tuesday in June were ridiculous with a 80 minute wait for ratatouille, the only 1 I really wanted to go on. And we tried to get fast pass tickets but they were all gone by 1pm which was the first time slot we were allocated after getting there at 10 am! We found the food prices okay..... however drinks we're pricey and I waited longer for a coffee than we waited for thunder mountain! It just seemed very disorganised and chaotic. Glad we've done it however I would not return, it didnt feel magical. ",0
36105,"It is a place for everyone, young and old especially kids and yet smokers are smoking everywhere, utterly insensible. I am not going back again.  And yes, adventure land was closed, along with some other rides like the popular carousel!",0
12445,"If you've already gone to orlando Disney, this is the same, but smaller. It's nice, they have some attractions and simulations, nice to go with teens.",0
36092,"Spent 3 days here with my wife and 14yo daughter. Stayed at Disney's Hotel New York so we'd get into the park early before the general public. A waste of time as most rides didn't open until 10am. Have been to parks in other parts of the world where crowds are managed so much better than here. Poor crowd control, poor food, poor service. Several major rides closed for renovation however we were not told of these closures when Disney took our booking. I feel cheated. Never again!",0
13989,"This place is so commercialize, so full of people, it is not really enjoyable for me. I do not have much good to say.",0
22354,"I was in Disneyland for a work conference and went to the park around five. I thought being there in the evening and at night would mean less crowds, but boy was I wrong. The wait times for popular rides were 2 hours! I am guessing in March there were some spring break crowds. I do not recommend going on a weekend in March! It was elbow to elbow crowds. I think too much is packed into a small park. I much prefer Disneyworld where you have some breathing room.",0

4513,This doesn't come close to the one in Orlando.... The rides are far too few and the place is more of an extended shopping mall than an amusement park. Didn't live up my expectations. Plus the park ticket for a day is 549 HKD which isn't worth spending as it takes less than half a day to see the entire park...you can give it a miss. ,0
4514,"During the weekends and public holidays, there are generally long queues for everything which means that you cannot do everything in one day or that day would have to be a very long one. The rides cater more to the under 10 as there are few thrilling rides for the tweens and teens. The shows are quite professionally done and are crowd pleasers. There's a lot of shopping of DISNEY items and the food outlets are average and expensive.",0
12451,"Ok here we go went with the family for 4 days in July , I had to rent a scooter due to injury to my back and I was worried if I could even handle going. Day 1 was not too bad but we left very early due to my health . Day 2 was very busy and we spent most of it in the other park. Day 3 we decided to watch the fireworks and the electric lights parade and we found a spot early off to one side ,this is where the biggest problem began, during the parade a family crowded into my space even placing their young child on the back of my scooter when I protested the lady started giving me attitude then her husband joined in , any ways at the end of the parade they moved away with a few more comments.. we stayed in the area for the fireworks, the same family pushed their way in front of me and completely blocked my view this time there was words exchanged and he accuitly threw a punch at me . Disney really has to address the problems with viewing areas for those in wheelchairs and those people that are handicapped. The park we have been several times in the past always for several days at a time this time I have to say was not enjoyed by me for several reasons it is starting to really show its age and several rides and attractions were closed I really believe this is the last time I will going to me it is just not worth the money or aggravation,",0
36084,Wow what a let down.... This park is no Disneyland and should not even be associated with the name.  So many opportunities to make money here if only the management of the park was better.  Very unprofessionally run and just a very disappointing experience.,0
30192,"Disneyland Paris in Not Disneyworld. Don't be disappointed. Several rides were out of order when we visited the park. Employees closed lines right in front of you for the shows and there's at least an hour for the next show one. Hollywood Studio closed earlier then the park, a small detail that I overlooked. Plan to visit the Studio first. The castle was beautiful, don't forget to visit the dragon. The Marvel show was great, a must see. Overall an enjoyable place to visit for the day and lots of fun things to do.",0
36082,"Our family has visited Disney World and Disneyland many many times. So when we took our trip to Europe, we naturally had to stop at Disneyland Paris. The park itself looked great. Very clean and the imagery and rides were up to Disney Standards. Unfortunately, the guest relations, while not rude, were less than  magical . One gets the feeling your at a run of the mill amusement park where the workers are going through the paces until their shift ends. We went in March, during off season, and many rides and food outlets seemed to be running on half staff. So we spent a lot of time in line, even though the park wasn't crowded.In the end, if you haven't been to Disney World, it's probably a nice experience. But if you have, your bar might be set too high!",0
7906,"The park was great, and everything. Long lines for the characters, but that is to be expected. Had one issue at the restaurant across from the jungle cruise called Riverview Cafe. Seemed they did not like I was American, who knows. My gf and I ordered food, then two couples came after us and ordered. They ordered heaps of food, we just ordered fried rice and coke. The two couples received all of their food, portion after portion while my gf and I were starving and looking at the other couples with envy. As soon as I spoke to the manager our food came. Call it coincidence or not, but we immediately left and refused to pay. Who knows the true story, but we ate at a different restaurant called The Explorers Club and it was excellent. Just Avoid the Riverview Cafe.",0
36080,"Ok, so maybe i was naive... I never went to disney world as a child, but i had these visions implanted from movies of Walt Disney personally greeting visitors, Mickey Mouse surrounded by kids and a beautiful Cinderella leaning over and patting the heads of little princess wannabies... And fair enough... A Saturday in June is not the best time to go, and i guess 70 minute queues to most attractions and multiple attractions closed is what i should have been expecting and been mentally prepared for... But Donald cordoned off? Mickey not publicly available... Seriously, with the prices that are being charged, could this place not afford to have 20 people in Mickey Mouse suits canvassing the area so that all kids get to shake hands with the worlds most famous mouse? why do you queue for 40 minutes at a fast food bar that serves 3 set menus when there are no more than 5 people ahead of you? Don't get me wrong, the few rides we managed to do, the kids really enjoyed, but how do you respond to a 3 year old who asks you: mummy, you said this was Mickeys house, so where is he ?Despite everything, the kids liked it. I Only wish that there had been just a pinch of pixie dust... That magic of the disney films i hold so fondly as a childhood memory.",0
36079,Spent a total fo 7 hours waiting in line and barely 15 min riding. Then waiting for food probably 40 mins . Rides are a thrill..lol not... Boring for anyone whom has been anywhere I mean anywhere else this park will leave you wanting and wondering why put yourself thru it . The most expensive way to spend a day wasting time and money.,0
36078,We had a terrible day at Disney Paris The staff never smile and half the rides are being renovated which is appalling during the busiest time of year.There were no characters to see in the streets and not enough carriages open with refreshments throughout the parks.Lunch at lucky nuggets was the only thing we liked but the staff don't smile I guess that's a French people thing !!!!Putting it out there because we've been to the Disney Orlando and Anaheim and this park disappointed us.To the point were we were very upset even when waiting for the return shuttle bus there were no benches to sit and everyone sat on the street curb. Would it be a lot to ask for a few park benches?I won't be back EVER!!!!!!,0
36077,"Disneyland Paris was awful. I recommend never going. Lines for anything  Don't Miss  were over 60 minutes and it wasn't a public or school holiday. Many, many things closed including a restaurant that didn't have a sign on it at all and we weren't the only people waiting for it to open at 11:55am. Then had to queue for food and toilets. At 12:30 the children's menu had run out at the Mexican place   it's a children's themepark!!. Our7 year old thought that the tacos that we did eventually get were delicious so that was a minor bonus. The buildings were tired and in need of paint. There was nothing magical about Disney at all! The final insult was just as we were leaving (after having been there for 7 hours and been on 4 rides   total ride time approx 12 minutes and wait time hours   they announced a spectacle on Mainstreet that sounded a like a parade so kids got set up and ready to see at least something spectacular but it was just ONE horse drawn cart with a movie character in it. Kids 14, 10 and 7 didn't enjoy Disneland at all   what a waste of a day!!!",0
8856,This is not even funny to spend money like this and visit.  Nothing even close to Los Angeles Disneyland,0
30182,"Being from Southern California originally, my family goes to Disneyland once every couple years. It was very neat to experience this park and to commend on the similarities and differences between the park and the patrons. Overall, we had a very nice time and I would definitely recommend to any Disney fans. My only problem with this park was the number of rides which were down for maintenance. Very disappointing. Make sure you check in advance before you go. That won't guarantee, as some of the rides which were down were not scheduled to be down. ",0
22344,"Waited my entire life to go to Disneyland but pretty sure the entire population of New Zealand was there on the day we went, even though we tried to plan it to coincide when kids were still at school. Took advantage of the magic mornings as we were staying for at the Disney Hotel, and even that wasn't enough to beat the crowds despite queuing up a whole hour before the park opened for Magic morning.They open the gates and start letting people through but just as you get to the end of Main Street they stop everyone and it becomes a stampede of people running and pushing and shoving. Crazy mothers with strollers just run at you and Except you to get out the way or be mowed down.The queues were about two hour and a bit waits, the food was horrible, we ordered Mickey Mouse pancakes and got a pancake with a tiny piece of pineapple for the mouth and two raisins for the eyes....no maple syrup, no powdered sugar, no whipped butter, it was dry and vile.Fast passes went quickly for Space Mountain which we got on once before it was closed down for maintenance, The Matterhorn was not operational for a good part of the morning!Indiana Jones and Nemo sub marine were also closed. By midday we gave up and went across to California adventureland which is better than Disneyland by a million trillion miles. I wanted it to be fabulous and could have cried I was so disappointed. Flag it and just stick to CA land.",0
30181,LONG lines and a lot of rides not running. I thought if it was the 25th celebration most all rides would be open not the case. We were willing to use the single rider option but they were not using them! The park was clean but most things need a new coat of paint. We only saw two characters the whole two days we were there except in the parade and the princess show...very disappointing. My suggestion is to come to the USA and enjoy what Disney has to offer at it's best. Loved all the Mickey ears but didn't have hardly any hats or caps limited selections on T shirts.,0
8872,The price $399hkd adult is so not worth it! Its very small and really not for teenages adults. Childrens will love it though! The parade in the afternoon and the fireworks display at 8pm is worth the moment. Expensive to buy food and souvenir same like other parks. Why can't they lower the price so every child customer walks out the attraction with a memento? Look out for the walking rubbish bin.,0
30158,"Yes, Disneyland is an ultimate destination especially for children, but the  fairytale  feeling fades quickly once you realize that you have to wait around 40 minutes or so, for EACH ride.. Kids get really tired and  joy  is replaced by other negative emotions such as  boredom  or  frustration ... So, its best not to visit the park during the summer, or any other high period. Snacks and beverages are overpriced, but I guess that is expected.",0
7899,"we went there on 1st july. it was HK public holiday...pls take note that bag will be checked before entered the premise bcoz no outside food are allowed except baby food..we reached there ard 11.00am and tried the 1st ride ..watched the parade at 1pm and planned for another ride..the weather was so hot.. the local already prepared with their umbrellas and cap etc.. pls be careful (mind your head) with their umbrella bcoz they dont care abt ppl next to them..make sure you apply sunscreen during summer season..ard 2pm there's announcement mentioned abt cyclone warning level 3 and the rides are closed immediately due to safety reason, only indoor ride attraction are open..we are so very unlucky because we unable to finish not even half of the rides due to bad weather. .since we just bought 1day pass, so it's kinda wasted we cant try to finish the rides..there's 2 restaurant that served halal food for muslim, 1 at mystic point and another one at adventure land.. me and my friends tried halal rstaurant at mystic point, the food portion quite big..the food was okay..my advice, pls check the weather forecast before you plan to go there to avoid things happened to me..if there's cyclone warning level 1 or 2, better dont go on that day..",0
15505,"I had always wanted to go to Disneyland ever since i was a child watching the TV show on a Sunday night, so on our first trip to America with our children (10 & 14) i finally got there. It was good, but you need to do your homework.We only had 1 day so decided to do the original park. Maybe a mistake with the age of our children but still had fun (and they dont love scary rides).Thinks to do  1. Get their early (we drove from downtown (weho)and drive was okay (against most traffic)2. Use the fast past ticket line system (have a good read of how it works)3. Go in a clock wise direction (after getting fast pass for the busy rides)4. Try to go mid week, non holidays in winter5. Talk your kids out of waiting in line for the matterhorn (2 hour wait the day we were there with no fastpass)6. Remember were you parked your car (the carparks are huge)7. Have fun & takes lots of cash",0
30161,"Visited Disney Paris and what a waste of time and money. If I knew I would be wasting our time at this resort I would have spend my money on something else.We stood in lines for ever and ever. I think 90% of the day was spent queing. Everything, and I mean everything, was in French. Yes it is their official language but there were people from all over the world and you would think they will at least try an international language like English. In Hong Kong they do it, why not in France?WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. An ABSOLUTE waste. They will never see us again.",0
31465,"What can I say ... we all know it's Disney, there was queues for everything. The place it's very clean and tidy and the staff polite, from security, to ticket sales and rides staff.The rides are feeling a bit aged ... but it's fun if you like to queue for 50 mins for 5 mins fun.The worst thing ..... everything it's stupidly expensive. They have a monopoly, but why rip off people and families who want to have a fun day. Bag of crisps 5 euro, burger meals for 2 adults, two tots over 50 euros !!!!!!Have fun ... but hey it won't be cheap.",0
8879,I went for a week stay in HK with my family and visited the location.The journey on the train is recommended as it has its own disney train. : ) Hence it is pretty convenient but you need to buy the octopus card as it makes the travel easier.The entrance fee was pricey and expected and was pretty crowded when we went there and it seems that we have a number of mainland visitors there too. We had to queue for quite a bit for all the required rides. Weather was turning warm and it was not fun.    suggest parent with young kinds to pack sunblock lotions for the kids and check the weather before departure.Food was pricey as expected and attractions was nothing out of the ordinary. We (& wifey) especially enjoyed the theatre performance where we had the Mickey mouse show or something    recommended to try. Other rides is the same which you would get from any other theme parks.,0
6612,"My initial impression of HK Disneyland wasn't great. When we got there, we were inundated with overly loud and tacky music. We then had to queue up in 3 different places.Once inside, the loud music continued and as far as the eye could see was overpriced merchandise and queues to get photos with characters.We then continued to the themed areas and went firstly to  Adventureland . This was perhaps a mistake, because quite frankly it was rather boring.After that, however, it got much better. All of the other areas were much more entertaining and I started to get into it. That was until lunch time. Upon viewing the menu, I actually looked around to see if there were hidden cameras. The prices were more than double what you would pay in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is one of the most expensive cities on Earth.Nevertheless, we had lunch and then proceeded with a much lighter wallet for the rest of the day. By the time we got to dinner (because we HAD to stay for the fireworks) I just handed them my wallet and told them to take whatever they wanted.Actually, to be a little more fair, getting back to the merchandise, it wasn't that overpriced. I just didn't like the fact you were inundated with it as soon as you entered the park.The bathrooms are plentiful and pretty clean, which must be quite an undertaking.The rides are on the junior side, but there are a few to entertain the adults.Overall I did enjoyed the day with kids. I'll just have retire a few months later, to pay for the meals.",0
4475,"Its really a nice place for kids..Younger kids from the age of 3   12.I suppose so. Coz as parents we enjoy just becoz our kids are enjoying. Otherwise its not anywer close to universal studio in Singapore. Myself, my husband and my eldest son 11 yrs loved univeral studio more than disneyland and to surprise disneyland is more costlier than univeral studios ! Anyways its a best place for young kids...and should never miss the ending fireworks.",0
30165,"Our kids were begging to go here, but we were generally disappointed. Many of the rides are similar to what you find in Florida and California. The Indiana Jones ride was a huge disappointment. The Star Port is just a photo op with Darth Vader. If you are in Paris, why the heck are you coming to Disney?",0
30166,"What a terrible disappointment. We chose to spend our last day at Disney Paris   what a bad decision.The ONLy good part was the parade   it was exceptional.EVERYTHING else was disgraceful and a complete rip off.Many of the rides and restaurants were closed, which resulted in long queues everywhere...we waited for an average of 45 minutes per ride   VERY frustrating for kids aged 7 and 9...and really annoying for parents.Honestly, waiting for almost an hour for a 5 minute ride is NOT okay.What do they allow so many thousands of people in when the facilities available cannot cope.This is just ridiculous in the middle of summer, high season.....why don't they refurbish their attractions in winter when there are less people visiting?Totally ridiculous.We had to queue for a cool drink, pop corn and all the food and the prices were exhorbitant and the food was atrocious.Overall it was just a shabby money making scheme, riding on the back of the Disney label,We STRONGLY advise anyone visiting Paris to just avoid this awful experience. Coming from Cape Town, South Africa...our local amusement park is significantly better....on every level.We loved Paris but truly regret the time and money spent here.AVOID.",0
8877,"FIrstly, this place is small comparing with other theme parks around the world... there was no magical moments as we saw long lines everywhere due to public holidays in China. But again, whether it is weekend pubic holidays or not, there will be long waiting lines due to the demand from mainland China. Fast Pass access was limited to 3 rides which I find it quite ridiculous.Food and drinks were everywhere however as expected the prices were astronomical! Good tip, bring your own bottle water and you can refill at the the drinking stations near the toilets. They charge HKD20 for a small bottle of mineral water! There were many souvenir shops and these are tourist traps and they keep reminding you to buy stuffs are over priced.Overall, a very average experience and would not go back again.",0
8876,The Hong Kong Disneyland is very small as compared to other Disneys in the world.  The days we visited were extremely crowded.  We had to wait more than 30 minutes for each ride.,0
15496,"I've always loved Disneyland, having visited the California park twice as a child and the Orlando resort twice in the last 4 years, on a recent trip to LA I thought I would re visit the original Disney. Big mistake and an even bigger waste of money.Once through the gates it becomes very difficult to negotiate your way around the park as you are met by a sea of people, push chairs and scooters. Queuing times for all rides were in excess of an hr and this was mid week out of peak season. After 7 hrs in the park we only managed to get on 4 rides which was quite annoying given that we'd paid $135 for a ticket.When the parade began things got worse as a melee of people gathered to watch it and a stampede began during which I witnessed people and bollards being knocked over several times. There was little crowd control and it was quite apparent that too many people were in the park.If you want the Disney experience visit Orlando. Disney California is a waste of time and money, greed has removed all enjoyment. You will queue excessively for rides, queue for ice cream and even queue for the toilet. Not a pleasant way to spend the day.",0
36132,"Pros: Very cool detail into making the park 'magical' in its castles, themed areas etc Loved the gift shops, something for everyone. A few good rides Great for kids (until they get tired)Cons: Disorganized Some of the 'build up' for rides is lost if you don't speak French Poor signage Park is too big, you need a full day to cover everything Too expensive for what it is Main attractions closedI was so excited to go to Disneyland as my partner seems to like it so much but, unfortunately for me, I didn't feel the magic. We got up early and were at the park before the rides were open and it was already packed! The entrance was completely disorganized and the signage was not great. When the rides did open, they all seemed to be closed for technical issues which defeated the purpose of us getting there early. When they did open the waiting times for each ride was between 35 40mins (not even on a very busy day) and there were not many rides that had the 'fast track' option so it seemed to be a bit redundant... Furthermore the park is huge and seems to waste so much space so be prepared to do A LOT of walking, it really put me off because you can see that everyone is very tired from walking and even though parents have splashed out to buy their kids very expensive princess dresses from the shops even the kids just looked tired and unhappy. Having said all this, I still think overall the park is worth visiting once. It does have some very cool attractions and it has so much potential to be better, it just needs a makeover. Keep in mind, this park is for theme, not for thrills.",0
36127,"We were really looking forward to Paris Disneyland  we had been to California Disneyland and loved it so much decided to take time when in Paris to visit this one. We went on a Monday in the hope it would be quieter than a weekend, and therefore less waiting. We were very disappointed. I wondered whether the park is in financial difficulty. Many rides are closed for months due to 'maintenance'  and big ticket ones like space ,mountain 2 and the carousel, there are not enough staff and when you do see them they are nowhere near as friendly as the American staff. In fact, they are scruffily dressed and many of them do not want to talk to you. The fast pass system only allows one at a time and this means you end up getting stuck in long lines, you barely see characters walk around the park and on the occasion I did all I heard was Peter Pan tell a kid not to touch him and run away. So much of the park is closed (yes it is quiet) but this seems unacceptable when there are such long lines for food. The frozen welcome ceremony consisted of Elsa and Ana in a vehicle (no dancing or theatre) and lots of parts of the park seemed to be cost cutting. I was getting sick of being shepherded into toy stores and at the end I was particularly annoyed that despite rain and getting wet they made us walk an extra 5 minutes around barriers to the train station so we would walk near the toy store and cinema associated with disneyland. Our son cried in frustration at the waiting in lines and disappointment of the park. We left early and while I was disappointed to miss the fireworks I could not justify keeping my children up to 11pm to watch a show, when the rest of the park had disappointed. I am not saying the park is bad  if you like a fun park, this is ok  but don't call it disneyland. This park doesn't live up to the standard and has wrecked our memories of the disneyland brand. We won't return and wished we spent the day exploring paris.",0
8865,"Since we have been to many Disney Parks around the world and our children are getting older (11, 14 & 16) we have probably outgrown this version of Disneyland. However, for smaller children this is a great place and the park is well maintained and has enough activities for children at the age of up to 10 11.",0
33182,This trip to disney with my young family was disappointing. it was expensive and over priced. many rides were closed. The location was far from the city. its not worth the hassel to go.avoid if you can.,0
6608,This is our first time visiting the    ghost house    in Disneyland during Halloween. We bought the night ticket and entered Disneyland at 7p.m. We waited for around half an hour to visit each ghost house. The ghost house is not very terrifying; suitable for elder children    it took around 10 15 minutes to walk through the ghost house. The night parade is exactly like its television advertisement. The children were excited but it is not that attractive to adults. Firework at the castle was amazing; it starts at 21:00 every night. The music and firework cooperate to create a wonderful memory for visitors.,0
22333,"The way they run this is a joke! I took my kids here to get pictures with the princess so we stood in line for our turn. As we where waiting patiently for our turn about 20 little girls dressed like there favorite princess cut in the front of the line. I asked the employee, AKA Cast Member why was they aloud to cut in the line like that, and he said girls dressed like princesses get to go threw the line to have there pictures with the princesses first. How is that fare??? Is this what Disneyland has came to, is letting people cut in line and it's ok, they promote that! Wow!!! So They dress like the theme of the attraction and it's ok to take cuts, so I guess if I want to cut in line for the Haunted Mansion all I have to do is dress like a ghost, or Space Mountain dress like an Astronaut, or a cowboy for Big Thunder Mountain ect., and that's totally ok??? We will never stand in the line for Princess Fantasy Faire again!!!",0
4488,"Visited HK Disney Land with a close friend, though after the short train ride from HK to the station then onto the Disney Train there was nothing Special .. Once we entered we notice all the rides and attractions were Geared for young Children of 11years and below.. I feel that there are a lot better theme parks that cater for all ages.. Maybe they are just living off the name  Disney Land  will not return or recommend ",0
22335,"Nice park, a bit crowded. It is best to use the single rider lanes when available. Eat on off times. Check to be sure attractions are open, many were closed for our visit.",0
33185,"Let me begin by saying I am a huge Disney fan, but going to the park right now is a waste of time & money. Most of the rides are closed ( refurbishing and giving a much needed facelift to this park). We arrived knowing that most rides were closed, but what happened was the rides that were open kept shutting down. It was VERY DIFFERENT then either WDW or Disneyland in California, the Disney cast members were not very nice, as we had numerous members in our party with disabilities, and the fact that they do not have any scooters available ( only wheelchairs) made the day even more difficult. Next year the park will have it's 25th celebration. Wait for that, also on the website is the list of ride closures  Now that summer is over, and kids are back in school it will be a good time to go, but not on weekends, or holidays.. The Disney Magic was not found here... Except for our visit to Walt Disney Studios next door, ( get the pass for both parks online, before you go) Chez Remy.",0
36118,"Visited for five nights and stayed at the Disney Hotel which was excellent. We were a party of six including two young children who loved the whole experience. Without question Disney offer a wonderful package and I think is a must for all children   however   be warned , it is a very expensive trip. We took advantage of Fastpass and enjoyed a number of themed Dinners, all brilliant but very difficult to justify the cost. I was very disappointed with the level of service from the staff, with great expectations after experiencing Florida and California, I felt very let down by the French team. They desperately need to  understand  the Disney dream and appear to lack the professionalism and motivatin of their American counterparts.Would I take the Grandchildren again   yes but I'll have to wait for that lottery win!",0
36117,"Stayed at the Davey Crockett Ranch 21 june 2015 for 2 nights. First of all we had no problem with the Davey Crockett Ranch, yes there was building work and lots of it but the cabin was lovely, spotlessly clean and the closure of the pool and farm was reflected in the price. The problem was the parks, starting with the vast car park, travelators not working. It took 30 mins from entering the car park to reaching the entrance. We took advantage of the Magic hours on second day and got straight into the car park and managed to park in the A zone Hooray..only to find that the Studios was closed and the queue for the main park with only 1 gate open was at least 200 people long. 40 mins later we were inside, headed straight to Adventure land.. Closed After searching we found 2 rides open Peter pan and Buzz Laser, the only 2 so needless to say the queues were massive!! By the third day we had learned that if a queue was 20 mins or less it was only worth doing if you need to get out of the rain or rest your feet.Just to remind you this was a mon and tues in school time!! Ratatouille was by far the best ride we managed to get on but that broke twice in the 3 days we were there.Don't rely on the wait time add at least 10 to 15 mins. As for the food in the park, don't even go there.",0
22338,"I can't believe I'm giving Disney a poor rating. My family and I LOVE everything Disney!My first trip to Disneyland was in 1978   I was 10. It was the greatest place I had ever been. I went back in the early 80's and once again had a great time. This time was a let down.Why was it a let down? The only thing I can say is after 20  visits to Disney World I was expecting the same experience at Land. Disneyland is small and poorly operated.Here are some examples:Disney World $134   1 day park hopper   includes 4 parks Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot and Hollywood StudiosDisneyland $137   1 day park hopper   includes Disneyland and California AdventureMagic Kingdom is the closest to Disneyland so my comparison will be to MK.During the fireworks the castle pass through closes but most rides remain open at MK. We've been on the Dumbo ride during the fireworks   going off right over us.DL there were several rides closed   because of lines they close 1 hour before   losing about 1 1 2 hours of ride time. You can't be in line during the fireworks. The castle pass through was also closed.There are a couple of different parades at MK. The day parade which happens two times during the day and then the Electric Light Parade at night. DL had one parade that took place twice   4PM and 6:30PM.Disneyland does have a couple of rides that DW doesn't have. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was taken out of DW a couple of years ago. Unfortunately we tried to get in line just about an hour before the fireworks and it was closed   the guide didn't say it closes. We did ride Storybook Land Canal Boats. Note: they also close during the fireworks but the guide states it closes.A couple of rides that DW doesn't have are: Matterhorn Bobsleds   the line was 60 minutes long and no fast pass, Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage, and Indiana Jones Adventure   they were all closed for refurbishment. Not sure how long they have been closed or will be closed but it seems an odd time (spring break) to close rides. Small World was also closed along with Snow White's Adventure.Another complaint. When you purchase tickets to a Disney park you would think they could keep the characters out longer. Elsa and Anna were only available in DL from 9AM   3:30PM. The Fairies were 9AM   3:15PM and Merida was 9AM   3PM. The Princesses were 9AM   7PM. Even if we only did these characters the lines were so long we would have missed the majority of the park.The Royal Theater according to the DL website have a Tangled Show and a Beauty and the Beast show. There were no shows the day we visited. There was a greeter saying the theater was closed.Some things I found odd: asked for directions and the man pointed with one finger   so against Disney rules   always two or more fingersAsked an elderly worker a question and he was so grumpy. My question was do we have time to look around since it's a 20 minute wait or should we get in line right now? His response,  you have time but if you're even a second late I'm not letting you in . You would NEVER get a response like that at DW.Sleeping Beauty's castle is SO tiny. Not a big deal but......We watched the Mickey and the Magical Map show and that was very entertaining.Another good point of DL is Mickey and Minnie Mouse were out dancing on Main Street. You NEVER see them out of their tent in Fantasyland or in the parade at MK. You can see them at Animal Kingdom more easily.All in all our day was 3 out of 10. Maybe were spoiled with so many visits to Disney World. We won't be back.",0
24076,"So no one can accuse me of playing favorites, I'll start by letting u know I'm from Illinois. I've never lived in Florida or California. A woman asked me yesterday while standing in line for fast passes which was better. I didn't hesitate, Fl by far is better! I love Disney, have taken my children numerous times in the last 12years. Usually we go to Florida but twice we have made the trek to CA.   the good about CA, both parks are within walking distance of the Grand Californian Hotel. In fact the Ca park has a hotel entrance which I love. Also liked the spa on the property(received an excellent facial). That's the end of what's good about Disney CA compared to FL. Staff at park, hotel and restaurants are not nice!!! They just don't seem to care at all. Seriously snarky people! Only one extra magic hour in morn. None in eve. (Mind you They're were some staff that were excellent, the ride man on tower of terror,hostess at one of the restaurants) but on a whole the staff was bad, a lot just looked like they were done with this place and need a new job. Not helpful,not well trained, not happy. Seriously not used to this at Disney. If you are planning a trip to Disneyland you need to seriously consider Disneyworld so much better! More rides, kinder, caring staff, more to see. U of have to ride buses, boats or monarails to most parks but well worth it!",0
30179,"Had a terrible experience at Disneyland Paris. I bought the 1 day pass for both parks and we decided to visit Disneyland first. There were queues of 60   90 minutes at most of the rides we wanted to visit right from the start. They have stopped selling the old FastPass now and there is a new system wherein you can get a fastpass for each ride individually for free. What it basically does is give you a time slot to return to the ride that there is a huge wait in, and join the fastpass line at that stage. However if you have collected a fastpass for one ride, you will not get another fastpass till you have completed that ride.It took us a while to figure this system out as no one told us about it and nor is it mentioned on the website. Hence we wasted 90 minutes on our first ride. In all we could only manage 6 rides in the entire day due to it being so crowded. The Disney app is supposed to show wait times but kept glitching and going off so we couldn't use it to plan our day better. We decided to move to Disney studios at around 6pm only to be told that it would shut at 7 pm, even though the ticket says 10 pm. Only managed 1 ride there.The kids were really disappointed as a lot of the rides were either closed for refurbishment or kept breaking down causing even more delays. Last time I go to a Disney park. Very disappointing.",0
22341,"It was crowded. The only reason we went in was to see the Frozen Queen and Princess. It happened to be the most popular attraction. In the morning, they said they had 4 hour wait times   we went in the afternoon and the lady at the line acted like she was doing us a favor telling us it was just over 2 hours. I didn't mind waiting the 2 hours while my husband and toddler played, but some of the guest service folks were irritable and terse. In defense of Disney, we are not Disney fanatics. It's just not our dream vacation. We could have taken our entire family to hike the rainforest in Costa Rica for less money and wouldn't have to wait in line. We gave it a try and it was about as expected. We enjoyed the Character Breakfasts much more. ",0
36112," It is more than just good weather that makes this a pale imitation of the American theme parks. There is a different attitude to service and fun, the Orlando experience is over the top but exciting and memorable. Found this experience flat and uninspiring. My recommendation would be save up and go to America.",0
36111,"We went on June 16th, and too many rides were closed for refurbishment. Unlike Disney in the US, the website did not specify that all these rides were closed. And the Big Thunder Railroad broke down and had to be shut down for the rest of the day.Now is not a good time to visit, we felt cheated.",0
8969,"First off, if you have been to Disneyland in California or Disney world in Florida you will be a bit disappointed. My Wife and I took a side trip to Hong kong for a couple of days on our way back home to California. I always wanted to see how the different Disneyland properties differ outside of the U.S. First and foremost DO NOT compare this place to any of the Disneyland parks in the US, you will just hate your visit. The best way to get here is by MTR. there is a station that drops you off at the main entrance. We Came from Kowloon so it only took less than 30mins during the morning rush...not bad. If you do plan on coming here go visit the Big Buddha and the Monastery first and do Disneyland in the afternoon. The park entrance fee is about $55US. At first glance as you stand at the front you will swear that your at Disneyland or the Magic Kingdom in Florida, but thats where it ends. It's packed, and i mean packed! We really didnt go on much of the rides because of the lines...2 hours is way to long to wait. It's fun to try the diffrent foods they have here...like Fish balls...at DISNEYLAND?!?! awesome. The pictures was pretty much the highlight of the trip to HK Disneyland. Pros  it's unique, it's the cheapest i've ever paid to get into Disneyland. There is no shortage of people willing to take your photo..not just one shot..maybe 2, 5, 17..lol. The staff is very friendly. Cons  It's expensive inside the park. $45 for a sweater?!?! it's small...really small. People just walk right in front of you when your taking a picture..so freaking rude! it's crowded.You can finish the park in less than 4 hours.",0
8970,"If you love Disneyland's thrill rides, then HK Disneyland will be a little disappointing. The one rollercoaster Space Mountain doesn't even make a loop at this version of the park...however, it's a joy for families with small children who want a day out.",0
3830,"We bought the tickets from a local travel agency as it's slightly cheaper than buying the tickets on the spot or online. My husband did some homework before visiting HK Disneyland by charting down which rides or shows which we would like to see and experience. Hence, we didn't missed anyone of them. We would recommend you not to miss the Mystic Manor, Mickey and the Wondrous Book, Mickey's PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. Be careful when entering the park at 1030am as we experienced some hysterical kids running in to the park and a kid almost made my husband's camera fell to the ground. Another foreign visitor told me that the kids accidentally scratched her arms when they were running frantically into the park once it's opened.The firework display at 9pm was spectacular! Not to be missed. But do prepare that it's gonna be a big crowd going back together at the same time after the firework display.",0
36885,"Not brilliant, attractions are standard and expect queues. Given that a lot of English visit, McDonalds serve tea but NO milk and typically dismissive if you ask for some. May be a minor point but sort of sums up the French attitude to British tourists. Wouldn't rush back to visit either the centre or the country to be honest.",0
36878,"Same as the studios, more rides are required for the adult visitors to the park! Would be amazing if there were a lot more roller coasters! I felt there wasn't enough selection of rides, great for families and children but not so great for groups of adults teens that like the big roller coasters. Would return but would prefer to go somewhere better.",0
29894,"Me and 3 friends went to Disneyland Paris to spend the bank holiday weekend, one of my friends has recently had to start using a wheelchair, it was her first time ever going to Disney and had always been a dream of hers. On our second day we were discusted with the treatment she received , when trying to get onto a ride the staff were rude, shouted at her, told her she was forbidden on the ride because she could not walk by herself (hence the wheelchair and the fact we used the wheelchair ramp access) and between themselves talking about her and laughing at her in French obviously not realising that most schools in England teach French. Even if you didn   t understand French the hand gestures and pointing were enough to understand. We then found one of the managers of the entire park, waited to see her she apologised but couldn   t keep a straight face and laughed on a couple of occasions to which her end statement was    what do you want me to do about it it   s done   , so much for a magical holiday destination this was my 3rd visit to Paris and I will not be returning. Discusting !!",0
21898,"I had been to Disneyland in the past, first as a child countless years ago then as an adult 17 years ago. The childhood memories are but a blur but, from what I remember of my visit in 1997, I'd had a great time. Perhaps being with my young nephews had helped add some magic back then. My wife had never been so we we spend a day at the Magical Kingdom during a trip to Southern California in early June and both left somewhat disappointed. I'm not saying we did have any fun. Splash Mountain is still a riot and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was just a good as the last time. Indiana Jones was fine except for the damsel behind us who screamed non stop. However, other attractions such as the Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean seemed a lot cornier than I remembered. We did stick around for five hours or so but by mid afternoon we both agreed that we'd had our fill. In comparison, we got a lot more bang for our buck at Universal Studios.",0
36881,"This was ok, we had the fast passes but if you don't go straight to the rides you can use them on as soon as it opens then you miss out. We didn't know this, there are a certain amount of fast pass tickets they give out each day and once they are all taken that's it. We waited in line for some of the major rides for over 2 hours per ride, so the fast pass extra money wasn't worth it.",0
15829,Still a magical place although starting to look a little old. Rides need to be freshened up. Must go if you have not been before but California Adventure is a much better option if you have. If you have done both try Six Flags Magic Mountain. Queues are smaller and rides are more suited to age 10 and above. Very expensive too Disneyland. ,0
3963,"We felt that this Disney is quite overrated, as the rides are not at all thrilling, and we did not encounter a single Disney character during the entire day there. The parade and the light show were also cancelled due to impending weather. I feel that the place is best suited for family with small children, maybe 7 years or less, as the elder kids will look for better rides in which case the Ocean Park is a better option.",0
31506,"My partner and I are about to jet off to Universal Studios in Florida, and the excitement I feel at going back to that wonderful place reminded me that I hadn't left a review for our stay at DLP earlier this year. We went for the Star Wars: Season of the Force celebration, having booked two days, and were initially excited. When we arrived, that quickly vanished. Where to begin? The queues to actually get TO the entrance were unreal. No order, just a huge bottleneck of people funnelling through a couple of metal detectors. When we finally got through there, we discovered another queue, this time to actually get into the park. A WHILE later, we made it inside, and decided to have a bite to eat. Sadly, there wasn't really anywhere to sit and do that that wasn't already swamped with people, so we had to order counter service and basically sit on the floor. With that out of the way, it was on to the rides! Well, it would have been if there had been any with a less than 2 hour wait time. I gave DLP one star because the Aerosmith coaster and Tower of Terror were actually very good, when you actually got through the massive queues. As a huge Star Wars fan, I was looking forward to the show, however. That, and the sci fi themed area of the park. This part, however, was basically closed. Just let that sink in for a moment   They were putting on a STAR WARS celebration, and their Star Wars rides were closed. We nearly missed the show on the first day, because we asked about it at one of the information kiosks, only to be shrugged at vaguely because neither of us spoke French, and they apparently didn't speak any English. I should stress that the show itself was great, and salvaged the weekend for us. Sadly, I did not get a photograph with the  squad of stormtroopers  that we were promised would be patrolling throughout the day (2 guys showed up every hour or so, and were immediately swamped by people), and over the course of the weekend, we managed to get onto maybe 7 rides. And now you see why I am so excited to be going back to Universal, where they do everything so very much better. We'll stick to that in future, and won't be repeating our trip back to this badly run park. But hey, if you like massive queues and closed rides, this might be the place for you!",0
15835,"Hi, coming from NZ we didn't know what to expect, but whilst Disneyland was pretty, vibrant and busy. It didn't hold much attraction to anyone that didn't have a 3 to 8year old on their group. The rides, attractions , food , drink and shopping were definitely aimed at a younger market than our teenager. This could probably be emphasized by the management through some advertising. It was definitely in contrast to the older focus of Disney California Adventure just across from Disneyland which was much more suitable for us.",0
24141,"We spent one day at Disneyland and paid around $100 for the ticket to get into Disneyland and California Adventure. Having been to Walt Disney World in Florida, I am spoiled. I was surprised at how small the park was. We did see a lot of characters. But it was disappointing.",0
29890,I was advise by my holiday company to go to the city hall Donald duck desk for disabled tickets which we did they took photocopies of my blue badge and gave me four tickets for each of us my carer and my two grandchildren we went and hired a wheelchair as I cant walk that far the walk from the buses to the park was long enough all rides we went to despite being in a wheelchair and showing them my badge we were not allowed on we were told we needed a green card we left the park and went to the studios and again the only ride we could get on as there was no waiting was magic carpet ride still could not get on any others we were advised to go to the information desk who gave us a green card first ride we tried to use us we couldn't as it was reserved we got on one ride my husband was in agony trying to push a chair and trying to keep two young children safe as he has arthritis in his arms we had had enough so we had paid nearly three hundred euros for one ride no one moved for us the buses were the same my grandson fell over cutting his leg I took him into a store for first aid and was told to come back at two oclock I had been stung by a wasp earlier so I am glad I didn't go into a shock,0
36889,"I should start by saying that I am a fan of the Disney parks in the U.S. and have been to Disneyland dozens of times over several decades, and have also visited each of the parks at DisneyWorld, with the exception of the water parks. Disney has a reputation or the magic it creates and for how clean the parks are. We were expecting this at the parks in France as well, but it was not the case. The two parks are close together and it is easy to walk from one to the other to  park hop , and everything within both parks is relatively compact. There was far less walking than we were used to. We entered Disneyland Park first and headed straight for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, which was closed due to the cold weather. Apparently, since it was  2degrees Celsius, the track had frozen, but the attraction did open later in the day. It is nothing like the Indiana Jones ride we are used to. This one is a rollercoaster with a loop that goes upside down. Our next stop was Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The line said it would take 30 minutes, but it ended up taking over an hour. Inaccurate queue times turned out to be more common than we were used to, and most of the time, they underestimated the time it would take. We had gotten fast passes, but the attraction had a  technical difficulty  while in the Fast Pass line to ride again, so we weren't able to do so. Our third stop was the Phantom Manor, which is similar to our Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, but has different scenes, some of which may be scarier to young children. This ride also stopped for about 20 minutes while we were on it, and they turned all of the lights on. It kind of ruined the Disney magic. Based on our luck, we decided to head to the other park and try some of the attractions that are not available in the U.S. parks. We returned later and things seemed to be working better. We were able to ride several other attractions with no additional technical difficulties. We never made it to Fantasyland, as they closed it about an hour before the park closes so set up for the Disney Dreams show, which happens at park closing and is viewed on the castle. It was one of the highlights of the visit and I would highly recommend staying for it. when running, the attractions were just as much fun as they are at the other Disney parks. One of the biggest things we noticed was the amount of trash all over Disneyland, especially in the queues. There was a lack of trash cans available during the queues and people seem to just drop there trash everywhere. In the U.S. parks, this is cleaned up regularly by any  cast member  who spots it, and Disney has a reputation for how clean the parks are. Not so in France. We also saw cigarette butts everywhere. Apparently, in the queues outdoors, it is acceptable to smoke and many people do. They smoke all over the park. There did not appear to be any designated smoking sections like in the U.S. This is a cultural difference to be aware of if the cigarette smoke will be problematic, but at a minimum, Disney should provide ash trays if smoking is allowed. For the most part, restrooms were clean, except at the end of the night. At that time, we also noticed trash cans were overflowing. This lack of cleanliness was disappointing for a Disney park, but about typical for many other amusement parks. ",0
9067,"The Disneyland magic that we all know and love seem to be lacking at this park.The line for tickets, to take photos with the characters, and the rides were, of course, insanely long, as you would expect nothing less from a Disney theme park. Now add pushing and shoving and you have the perfect Hong Kong Disney experience.What you will notice is the extreamly small size. You can walk the entire park in under 20. The food is overpriced and tasteless. More gift shops than attractions or rides and all stocked with outrageously priced trinkets.The park lacked that Disney magic that we have all experienced with U.S visits. If you have been to any other Disney parks, then you will be disappointed . If you just want to brag that you been to all the Disney parks in the world check it out, than you can write your poor rating here too! If you just want the photo op, you can get a bunch of pictures outside of the park without paying anything . If you still are going to the park dispute my review...have fun!",0
31507,"Spent the last two days at Disneyland Paris. Totally shocked by the experience. Majority of the best rides did not work. Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Thunder Mountain all with  technical issues . Huge waiting times which often resulted in the ride being closed before one got a chance to go on it. Sheep like crowds prepared to accept the worst possible experience. To cap it all off many of the staff that work here don't seem to get the Disney brand they are supposed to be ambassadors for. Totally clueless and unhelpful. Seem to take pleasure in informing you of difficulties. No investment for last ten years, peeling paint, old rides and total lack of magic in the park. Can't understand how Disney can let 14 million people endure this every year. I would write to the Chief Executive if there was any point to save people this. He won't read it as he is too smart to visit the park with his family. The only saving grace is that in 5 years time the place won't exist as it will go out of business. ",0
3957,"Visited in 2010, and with a 3 year old. No evidence visited with 9 year old and 2.5 year old Sister. The atmosphere is totally different. The Disney Magic is lost. Used to like the loud Disney songs that is played the moment you reach the main gate,but this time round, the music was soft and not continuous. Stayed one night in Disneyland hotel, hotel was old and worn out, and worse, the sewage smell was horrible. Service crew were all angry folks and you can see that they are unhappy, for some reasons. Rather disappointing. Disney has lost its charm.",0
3968,"I visited Disneyland solo & while it doesn't compare to Anaheim, I still really enjoyed myself, even the rain didn't dampen my spirits! There were a few rides, and the longest I stood in line was 15 minutes. Don't miss Mystic Manor or the Jungle River Cruise. Festival of the Lion King is also one not to miss! You could should probably skip Tarzan's Treehouse as the best thing about it was the 30 second raft ride over there. Sadly, the main parade was cancelled due to the weather, but the Electric Light Parade (goes by a different name in HK) made up for it! It was spectacular! The only down point was being served a Mickey Waffle (which in itself was amazing) by an extremely rude staff member, who really didn't embody the 'Disney Spirit' at all! Other than that, an awesome day out in Hong Kong! ",0
9063,We were expecting a much bigger park then what we saw. Whilst the park was good it could be viewed in 5 hours at most. Ok for the kids bit I certainly wouldn't make it the basis of a trip to Hong Kong.,0
21901,"We drove here from Seattle and hoped to spend at least one day at Disneyland. We purchased 1 day Park Hopper tickets from the Disneyland ticket booth right outside the gates. Considering we were dropping $300, the cast member was really gloomy and unhelpful. At the end of the transaction, she said (unconvincingly),  Have a magical day.  It was really frustrating to visit on June 4th. It was the last day of school for the local kids so we thought we'd timed it just right. We were wrong. The place was so busy!! We had trouble getting on any of the rides without a long wait and several attractions were closed. Grizzly River Run was completely dried out and we saw the rafts sitting behind the fence near the entrance, by the Grand Californian Hotel. We ended up sitting around people watching for much of the morning as we got tired of fighting crowds to walk around in circles without being able to ride anything. We came back that night and found that it was full of local high school students, which would have been okay if they weren't hyped up from their last day of school. One group of boys came running up behind my husband and stomped their feet, scaring him. We later saw them bothering a security guard and talking a selfie with him. Anyway, it was even more difficult getting on rides from 9pm on because several were closed for parades and other events (which used to be perfect for drawing crowds away from the rides!) It's frustrating that they close off so many of the walkways during the evening events. Although the park may be open until 10pm or 12am, it's really closed early if you consider that many of the rides and areas are off limits. It would be nice if there was a way to get a certain   of hours per tickets so that if you didn't want to come back on the same hectic day, you could try another one with the same tickets. We feel irritated that we spent so much money and couldn't enjoy the parks. Next time we'll try to be more strategic about coming when kids are in school and maybe during a blackout date for the local annual pass holders.",0
13936,All I have to say is that there should be a cut off number of guests when corporate Disney can say we made enough money today and we gonna keep the numbers at a manageable number. Waiting in line after line for hours is not exactly a theme park experience. I've paid for VIP or front of the line at other theme parks but here it's different. ,0
36873,Writing this review whilst still in Disney. Up to now had a great time the rides are great the park is very clean & staff are friendly however the people who visit the park are not so friendly I've never come across so many awful people in my life they all look so miserable it's very odd. It's very very expensive totally overpriced for absolutely everything & that's saying something for me I'm not tight at all. I did expect it to be a bit overpriced but not this much ridiculous. My little boy is having a ball tho & his fave ride is pirates of Caribbean which I also thought was very good. The food here isn't great to be honest a lot of overpriced fast food the parades were great tho. So much queuing so wear comfy shoes & clothing waiting an hour for each ride today which I suppose you expect. Don't think I will visit again but still had a nice time here despite a few issues. ,0
3972,We have been to Disneyland in Anaheim and it is much bigger than this one. That said the parade that they have in the afternoon was spectacular and there has been no expense spared. The best rides are Space Mountain and the RC racer in Toy Story Land.I expected the food to be expensive but $105HK ( which is $21AUD) for 3 Mickey Mouse ice creams is ridiculous. The gifts in the gift stores didn't seem too overly priced. We got the 2 day pass and we went back on the second day in the afternoon thinking it may be quieter   it wasn't. The longest we waited was 30 minutes in a line but most of the wait time was 5 to 10 minutes. My daughter is 11 and she really enjoyed the day and that is what we all go to Disneyland for. ,0
9061,"As a kid I'd always dreamt about visiting Disneyland and the magic that I would experience. But now some 20 odd years later, I should have known better then to expect anything more then just your run of the mill amusement park. Yes it had all the disney characters and rides but it just isn't that great! The rides are definately catered towards little kids. There was maybe 2 or 3 rides that the older kids would find more exciting, all the rest are very tame. As expected the food is over priced and I think it sux that Disneyland does not allow you to take your own food in. So I think as a kid you will love this place but for me personally, its an average experienece. I also feel that the admission fee is way too overpriced.",0
15823,"I hadn't been to the original Disneyland in 30 years and it was the first time I had taken our children there. We had been to EuroDisney a few years which we was not nearly as crowded. My son just wanted to go on the rides, but with lines up to 90 minutes, it's not a great experience for a 9 year old boy. As a foreigner I was surprised how 99% of the people in the park were white.",0
25990,"$4.75 for a bottle of water? Really? Admission is a fortune already. Also, wish there was more shade for a lot of the lines, it was 85  during our visit. On a positive note, love the FastPass system!",0
36868,"We went to Disneyland with our daughter. Some aspects of it were magnificent. The parade was excellent and the park closing show was stunning. However the hard work was let down by some basic stuff. We went in the week during February, so defiantly not peak periods yet the park seemed unable to cope with the people. We queued for so many things and often felt like cattle in a market. But also I think they seemed to loose the magic in some ways. We can go on similar rides in most theme parks through the world but our kids (and us) want to see the Disney characters. You could queue up for ages (75 mins to see a princess because there was only 1 in there!!!!?) but why doesn't the park have people dressed as princesses, or Goofy, Micky etc just walking around. That personal touch is the difference between us coming back again or not. I don't want more rides, I want Disney magic.",0
36867,"I am a HUGE Disney fan and my family could never afford to take me as a child, so now that I am an adult and I can afford to go, I thought my dream would finally be coming true. Dream come true, not quite. Firstly on the Disneyland Paris website it states that if you are staying at specific hotels in the area, you can get free parking in Disneyland if you show your check in details, this is not true. We stayed at the Radisson Blu which was mentioned as one of the partner hotels associated with the free parking and we got told we had to pay, and that we were wrong, even though it was on the official website. Secondly there were absolutely no Disney characters walking around which is one of the things I was looking forward to the most. Instead you had to queue up to see Mickey, Minnie and Goofy. There were no Disney Princesses anywhere or other characters, so this was a huge disappointment for me. Most of the staff had absolutely no enthusiasm, which I find odd since they are meant to be working at 'the happiest place on earth'. I know jobs can become very mundane, and the novelty must wear off but surely working at Disneyland, its their JOB to be happy and be enthusiastic. The most enthusiastic individual was the man who was working on the Captain EO attraction, he was genuinely excited and really got the crowd in the mood for what I assume is one of the least popular attractions on the park. I felt that there wasn't much for adults to enjoy in the actual Disneyland Park in fact the only things that adults could do is buy food in the restaurant or go in the countless number of shops in the area! the only real message I got from Disneyland Park was not one of a magical experience but more 'give us your money!' There was hardly any references to any of the films really, like there were a few themed areas like the snow white ride, peter pan's flight, and Sleeping Beauty's castle but absolutely no references to things like the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or even The Lion King. It didn't FEEL as Disney as I thought it was going to be. In the shops there were no lion king merchandise, the only lion king merchandise they had was in adventureland and it was a few teddies.Walt Disney Studios was better since there are more rides, and things to do. However, staffing is an issue here too. The man who put us in the lift for Hollywood Towers Hotel had no problem showing that he didn't want to be there, he only spoke in French and when my boyfriend and I didn't understand the instructions he made it very clear how irritated he was at us that he had to repeat the instruction in English then proceeded to deliver the rest of the spiel in French. The food is very expensive which was to be expected. On the plus, the Hollywood Tower, Phantom Manor, Rock n Rollercoaster, RC Racer, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean were brilliant, although these alone are not worth the price you pay for your ticket,   65 is not worth a handful of rides, expensive food and merchandise, and miserable staff. Although I did enjoy my time here, I would not come back again, I'd rather save and go to Florida. Maybe my expectations were too high, but surely you'd expect that for Disneyland?",0
15821,"We were visiting from Orlando so we wanted to see the original Disney park. We had the opportunity to spend 2 days here at the park and Disneyland Hotel. The park was fun and has some great rides which we thoroughly enjoyed, especially Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, and the Matterhorn Bobsleds. What was disappointing is they had multiple rides all closed for refurbishment at same time. Definitely think this should be managed to not have more than 1 closed at a time or offer a discount on tickets. Pay way too much for multiple things to be closed and not available. Also felt like service was less of a priority here   didn't feel they had that magical service focus where they go above and beyond to be friendly and provide that welcoming experience. Ride operators frequently came across as abrupt and annoyed. Definitely like the park and would enjoy coming at a future date when all attractions are available. ",0
36865,"We visited California Disney about 7 years ago. We loved it and spent three full days enjoyed every suitable attraction. The rides were all like an experience or adventure. With that in mind we decided to spend one day from our European trip at the Paris Disneyland. We arrived by car on time for the opening at 10am. It took some time to get from the car to the entrance however this was ok as they had supplied travelators. As for most places now we had a bag search, then as We had pre purchased tickets we ust joined the gigantic mass of people, no queues, and pushed and shoved until we went through a turnstile. We saved 5 euro per ticket by buying at a local hotel. Cost was about $100. With forethought in Australia we could have saved much more by buying online. As we couldn't access a printer we couldn't do this in Paris. As it was winter the crowds were OK. The rides were generally just amusement park style, not Disney style. The haunted house was pretty good, the Indiana jones just a roller coaster, not anything like the real Disneyland but ok for what it was. The railroad ride was fun. The teacups were fine and the dumbo ride was the same. Star tours was a good ride and the laser ride buzz light year was fine with a fast pass. Aside from that the rides were boring and not very many of them. Many attractions were closed for winter maintenance without any warning of this when purchasing tickets. The food areas were packed with not enough seating, and very expensive food. The stores all sold the same items, as expected overpriced. The store assistants were surly, and on one purchase the man was extremely rude and nasty. I really did not feel as though I was in Disneyland. I saw three characters only all day (outside of the afternoon parade) and they were moving from one venue to somewhere else and refused to stop for children or photos. The only way to see any of the princesses or mickey was to line up for up to an hour. When standing in the street for the parade the security type people were rude and pushy and continually barked at everyone to get back. We left after that although we still had extra time left as we were not enjoying it. The atmosphere of the USA Disneyland was so lovely and this was nowhere like it at all in any way. I would hate to be there in summer as even at this time in the middle of winter they couldn't cope with the numbers of people. The park is too small for the crowds and needs to be enlarged and give the staff public relations training.",0
36864,"I grew up in California, so Disney and Disneyland were huge influences in my childhood. I grew up going to Disneyland (Anaheim CA) at least once a year, and still go regularly. That said, my trip to 'Euro Disney' just didn't measure up. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just doesn't have the  magic  that Disneyland is supposed to have. My only concrete example would be the indiana jones rode. In CA, indiana jones involves an amazing intricate queuing area with tons of stuff to see and play with, and the ride consists of a car on a track that bumps and jolts around and is very entertaining going through an exciting set of caverns with skeletons shooting air darts and fire breathing statues. At Euro Disney... Indiana Jones is a somewhat uncomfortable and unremarkable roller coaster.So... it's disneyland, and I had a good time. But at the same time... it isn't.",0
36863,"This is certainly one for the kids, despite the rain that poured for most of our stay. We were only a short walk away from our hotel, but having to queue for EVERYTHING (in some cases more than an hour) became a bit much for our 7 year old. Great fun for the kids and young at heart adults, but surely there must be some way of managing the queues, or at least providing entertainment to keep the youngsters occupied?",0
29899,We stayed for two nights and whilst we had a good time we found the park massively over crowded. There are simply not enough major rides resulting in massive ques even for the fast passes. We got the park early as we stayed in a Disney hotel and this is when we got on the rides. Once the park opens to the general public it becomes a nightmare. Just my opinion.,0
15819,"We've spent here two days with 3 kids (ages 1 , 4  and 7) sleeping at a nearby Best WesternWe've been to both parks   first day to Disneyland, second day to the Adventure parkEach day we split into two heading back to the motel for a noon nap   rest   regain energydoing this was really great as it allowed us to maximize the experience and have the kids up till late to see the parade & night events, which are amazing!The parade (at Disneyland) was by far more unique and impressiveTransport   at first we used the shuttle with a day pass (5$ per adult, 2$ per child). It wasn't efficient. We spent 20  minutes for each shuttle (as it happened 3 times I wouldn't say it's just our bad luck...) and it was more of a hustle than anything else. One time, for the sake of discussion, I even headed to the motel by foot, and guess what... I got there 10 minutes ahead of them!The second day we took the car into the parking lot (Mickey) and from there the tram to downtown Disney   was way more efficient and this is my recommendation to you, just take the car, pay the 18$ day pass for the parking lot and head in   out as much as you'd like. BTW   the load on the tram at night, after the show, was lower compared with the load of passengers awaiting the shuttlesFood   damn, what a rip off... At least at the adventure park there was good beer!Undersized portions with a crappy (pardon my french) nutrition contribution. And lousy taste, making any other fast food feel like an upscale restaurantThe adventure park is cool, smaller, we could fit all in one day (2 parts as mentioned above) with no problem. The cars race was amazing!!!! Highly recommended, we did it twice, and it is always packed, so make sure to have the fastness asap. It is near the entrance, right at the bugs' land gate. This park is also not as crowded as the Disneyland one.In Disneyland, do note that after the show it's a looooong way out. And slowYet, it is damn fun and kids loved it. So did we. We've got enough of this for the decadeSee ya next time!",0

Hotel Seqouia lodge was brilliant, couldnt fault it, we went to celebrate my girls 4th birthday, when we got to the hotel we advised the staff that we wanted to dine at cafe Mickey that night, got told we would have to hurry to the concierge desk as the bookings go really quickly, this was 8am, and there was one booking left at 9:30pm, i quickly booked it as we were only visiting for a short time, and for the next day they had one booking left for 5:30pm.. Meal was good but we arranged for a cake,   20 for a ice cream cake!! Which we couldnt take anywhere? The next family was the same as us, after ordering desserts you find out its an ice cream cake, so many birthdays and you could see all the cakes left behind!! This was so dissappointing.. I cant help feeling dissappointed for somewhere ive always wanted to go visit, to meet the princesses was 120 minute wait in February! A snotty french guy telling us this at the gates..overall kids were okay with it, they havnt asked to visit again so wouldnt go again, the characters in the mickey cafe were fabulous, so was minnie...loads of attractions were closed or being repaired, so unfair as no matter what time of year you visit people spend alot of money to visit places like this..i was also expecting to see alot more characters walking around, we didnt see Donald once apart from the parade, done it, wouldnt go again...most of the staff at the park were very friendly so well done for that Disneyland Paris.",0
25996,"I purchased two annual passes online. All info was correct. Order didn't process. Tried again. Then tried next day. It kept saying transaction could not be processed. Talked online to chat representative named Amy. She looked up the order but it 'didn't process'. She said just to show up. So my time online both days was wasted cutting into vacation time. Then i found out my debit card was charged for all my attempts   8 times $174! I called and spoke to customer service who neither offered free passes when asked or a complimentary upgrade on the season passes. instead he said to drive an hour and a half to the box office who  might  be able to give free passes. I have no money left on card to purchase anything, and now am down $3192 and they say I have to wait 2 3 days for the charges to drop off. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, the guy transferred me to a 'survey hotline' which then hung up on me.So I could not buy passes, the debit card was charged, the disneyland website was not working correctly despite all info being exact (checked and double checked) and then customer service didn't do ANYTHING to help alleviate the stress, or to offer compensation for two wasted days of vacation and no possibility of visiting the park.Complete disappointment.",0
29872,Hi. Me and my mum went to disneyland for her birthday and we were very excited. When we got there we went to studios because they close more earlier and we got there when it opened so we wanted breakfast... 45 minutes it took to get a drinks and a meal!! The queues were ridiculous and there needs to be more signs to toilets and stuff. In the daytime aswell it seemed so busy that one of the rides broke down aswell... we went and spent 2 hours waiting for the shell nemo ride thing and I hated it! There needs to be more rides which have fastpasses because there were only like 3 rides which had them and they were shut!! Last thing about the studios is that we went to magic kingdom to see the parade and stuff then we went back to studios cuz I wanted to do some sorta drawing and they had no wait times and they closed 2 hours before studios closes! People were dead rude aswell by not saying thank you and pushing around. We went to the eiffel tower after and no one was like that... kinda a rip off how it's do expensive aswell... When it hit dusk it wasn't as busy so we went to its a small world and it was perfect for me and small kids!!! There need to be more of that stuff... I'm in that situation that I'm too old for kids stuff and too young for the proper rides... all of france in fact was a rip off cuz in the airport all the vending machines were not working and just took our money!!! It was awesome walking through a cave with a dragon and another retelling aladins story in adventureland at night. Magic kingdom closes at 11pm and doesn't tell us it starts the firework show then aswell... we needed to go like 10 mins after if started to get the last bus to the hotel... we waited 1 hour for this and there needs to be more fastpasses and more information about things!!!,0
15851,"So we were celebrating my sons 5th birthday it was his first trip to Disney and I have to say it was very disappointing. I am a 90's kid that grew up going to Disney world so it was my first trip to Disney land. There were no character we spend the day at the park and only got 2 autographs and that was after waiting over an hour to meet Mickey. We never seen Minnie Mouse, Donald, daisy or even Pluto. We did see goofy and got an autograph but when we seen chip and dale as we got to lineup we were told that they were leaving. This continues to happen all day. Wel left the park with only 2 sad signatures. I think the characters need to be more available to the travelers if they need to walk away and switch the person inside the suit to make people happy then they should or I am sure there is more than one goofy suit that one can go in back and another comes back out with in 5 min a kid would think oh he just went to change clothes because he was hot or dirty . All the time we were told no for an autograph really made me say I will not return to this park and would rather save for the longer trip to Florida for a GREAT experience. Our family had meme we travel from Chicago and Arizona for this trip and it was not a great experience. :(",0
24145,"We have always lived in Arizona but.....have been annual passport holders since 1992. Sadly, we will not be renewing them this year.....Disneyland is not what it used to be and hasn't been for quite some time.I used to worship their management philosophy, even attending the Disney Institute in Orlando, but that was the first thing to go. You can now listen to, quite frequently, cast members gossiping about each other, cursing, being rude to and completely ignoring guests. They have resorted to selling nothing but complete junk in their stores, the food now resembles nursing home food...it goes on and on and is really sad!Granted, the park is breathtaking at Christmas, it's not enough anymore.Example: you've waited in line for 90 minutes for a ride...you've just sat down on the ride, the ride breaks down. Old school: you'd get a 1 time pass for you and everyone in your party, to any ride in the park without waiting in line, at all. Now, they just instruct you to exit to the right.I could go on and on but I won't, it's too sad.",0
3941,"My favorite was the Ocean Park, but he was very disappointing and the Disneyland was much better as expected!Main Street USA, Toy Story Land and Mystic Point have nothing for couples and also no good dining options. This three places in Disneyland had us disappointed and since the price of admission was sorely high, so I only can give 3 stars.At some places at Disneyland you can eat very well. Particularly pleasing were the many drink stalls, in view of the very great heat in HK (at our visit time)The  Jungle River Cruise  in the Adventureland was the best!!",0
15848,Great place if you want to be in a crowded place with screaming kids and sweaty adults. There were a few rides that were fun for adults. Be prepared to pay 10 dollars plus for a burger. I question the moniker of the  Happiest Place On Earth . Make sure you get Fast Passes for every possible attraction you can or you'll be standing in line for upwards of an hour on off peak times. ,0

29875,"I would recommend people avoid this place like the plague in holiday times2hrs min wait time for every ride we had, kids were bored and fed up with the queues being over 2hrs for everything.we had fast pass tickets ability which my sons used a couple of times before all the ticket machines were covered over.in total my 7yr old in the space of 8 hrs visited 5 ridesmy boys got the same result being teenagers we let them run for the rides but even they only got on a few rideswe have been to other parks like asterix and walligaytor and gone on so many more ridesby 6pm they were totally fed up of queuing up and wanted to go home, understandablyso much miliage between rides just tired em out and the fact the park was flooded with people.dont waste your money, looks good but it isntthere are more food places than rides",0
36922,"First off, I was disappointed. I love the Disney Parks, having been to Disneyland in CA several times & WDW in FL many, many times I was surprised by my own level of disappointment. I am into Disney's customer service, theme ing, attractions & food. I'm a fan! That said, Disneyland Paris did not meet my expectations in customer service or upkeep. It looked run down in many areas, it was unorganized, in terms of lack of queues for characters, timing for shows & parades(20 mins late, twice). The characters looked a bit shabby, like they get the hand me down character costumes from WDW. If you've never been to WDW, this park may seem acceptable for a Disney fix, but if you've visited Disney Parks in the States you WILL be disappointed. While my family & I did have fun at this park, if we were to return we would make it a day trip from Paris. The attractions were fun to experience, we enjoyed comparing them to the ones we've been on in other parks, most of the attractions were better than the ones in WDW, but again the poor upkeep was distracting from the magic. Phantom Manor, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain:Mission 2 were all wonderfully themed and beautiful, except for the lack of upkeep. It was fun to hear British accents on Princesses like, Snow White, Anna, Elsa & Jasmine. My family loved experiencing attractions in French, in fact they preferred that over the English options even though they don't understand French at all.  In regards to Cast Members, I wouldn't say they were rude, I would say that most seemed indifferent to interact with guests, not like WDW at all. So again if you are expecting Disney service like we are used to in the States, forget it! Their attitude may have had something to do with the way they were treated, I saw many guests being rude to Cast Members, acting like they own the place, talking down to them & not trying to speak French at all. Another note on guests, they smoke, they smoke a lot, there are smoking areas but nobody seems to use them. We saw many Europeans smoking around kids without concern & smoking on lines while waiting for the rides. This was hard to get used to since our family tries to live a healthy lifestyle & having to breathe in second hand smoke was not ideal. It was disappointing of Disney & their Cast Members to not make more of an effort to move smokers to their designated smoking area. The only time I heard an attempt was while at the Tower of Terror, when a guest decided to light up at the entrance to the lobby of the ride, a recorded announcement was made over the loud speaker & he extinguished his cigarette after one last puff. To our surprise we enjoyed the food, we weren   t sure what to expect and we were pleased that they were very accommodating with my kids' gluten allergy. We thought food presentation was artistic, the menu's variety sufficient enough to appeal to all 6 of us, the food's quality & taste were all superior to WDW (Sorry, WDW foodies). Transportation was easy enough, with buses running regularly & everything in decent walking distance. My husband & son often walked to & from the parks from our hotel, Newport Bay Resort. On several occasions we walked back & forth to both parks, we likened it to the distance between World Showcase & Future World at EPCOT, except you needed to show your ticket for entrance. Both park layouts were similar enough to MK and HS in FL that we were comfortable with our whereabouts very soon into our 5day stay. We really enjoyed Disneyland Paris' old school ways. They don't use Magic Bands, they still have Fast Passes, there isn't even the index finger ticket technology. It was just a scan of your ticket & you are in, that was refreshing.  All in all, we had an enjoyable time as we were able to experience something new & interesting, had we not been vacationing in Paris already & struck a very affordable package(20% OFF Hotel & Park tickets   FREE Half Board Plus meal plan   FREE Hotel & Park tickets for kids under 7   50    voucher )we might have been more disappointed. We are glad we experienced Disneyland Paris, even with all the negatives, I would just not recommend coming from the US solely for a trip to Disneyland Paris, visit Paris, then if you have time & money visit DP for a day or so. Even though we did not see or do everything((normally we conquer all)we missed CaptainEO, Arcades, Riverboat, Keelboats, Legends of the Wild West)) we felt we didn   t really miss out on anything & that our 5days visiting both parks was more than enough time to visit DP.",0
24143,"Disneyland isn't what it use to be, crowded and people can just cut into line at anytime and no one does a thing about it. Employees on their cell phones...the only good experience is the breakfast with the characters, which my grand daughters enjoyed. So disappointed that the work ethic has left Disney and all they want is Money any more , guess its the great American way.",0
3936,"Visited in early Jun with family. It's too much hyped, though few things like parades and shows are good. Taking photo with Characters are really frustrating and that to in hot sun. You have to wait for hours. They should have few more characters roaming around for photo pose.2 rides in tomorrow land and the roller coaster in adventure land were closed.",0
15852,"Disneyland and Park are still living in the 1980s  pre internet, pre overall technology when it comes to their offerings of rides that have been there since I was a kid, however. The tickets prices have been on a VERY STEEP RISE. The value is just not there, especially when you find the management doesn't care about the LONG LINES and the countless hours people wasted for a 90 sec. to 5 minutes rides. Theme parks in Dubai and other countries are light years ahead in terms of innovations and technology usage. Disneyland is a legacy, and it's milking that legacy to the last drop. Fantasmic show is the same since the early 1990s! Soaring over CA is the same too. How hard is it to update the two shows and offer different versions? I had to go for some family reasons, but if it wasn't for that, I DEFINATELY won't go.",0
15853,"I have been here to many times to count and I still enjoy it. What I don't enjoy are all the closed rides, at the time of our visit, and they need to work on traffic flow around Tomorrowland. It seems every time we go down there you can't get around all the strollers under the monorail track, its a bit petty I know.",0
36926,Was hoping to enjoy a out with my duaghter as we love theme parks but for those of you that may be trusting don't be fooled! We in effect trusted one of the theme park administrators managers but got sucked in by french italian hospitality only to go on an attraction that lent itself for our backpack to be opened and our digital camera stolen.So keep your belongings on the front of you at all times don't be fooled into getting access to the front of the line! and enjoy the rides and not frustrated at the possibility of losing some dear memories of what could have been an enjoyable day.,0
36927,"My husband and I visited Disneyland Paris from the 27th   30th December 2014 with our two children aged 2 and 7. We had never been before, and will never go again!!!! We queued for 3 hours for crushes coaster and the mine train and they weren't even the longest queues in the park. Far to busy, they should limit the amount of tickets sold. I thought that the characters would be walking around the park but no, that's another thing you had to queue for (about 20 30 mins) for a photo. Its really not fair on the children, what a waste of money! I can safely say that its not a magical experience and more of a money making machine.",0
29874,"We stayed at the Newport hotel and visited for 4 days. The hotel was fine, very basic but did the job for what you need it for. The character meet and greets were a good touch even if they queues were quite long.The disappointment was the park   it   s not fair comparing it to USA Disney but it falls so far short it   s incredible. We came for meet and greet with Captain America which relies on an App to book....it is impossible to book anything on the app. So basically, the feature attraction is unattainable. Complaints about this are dismissed by customer service staff out of hand. In general staff are not Disney standard   very little is done to answer questions or deal with issues and there is certainly no evidence of going above and beyondThe choice of attraction is ok, though availability of Fast Pass is poor. It is employed on some attraction when not needed and is missing on others where it would be useful.Falls well below what I perceive the Disney experience to be",0
36914,"Well, it looks nice and artistic and the night show is beautiful and nicely designed. It is just not a happy place. Staff has no enthusiasm for being there. slow and grumpy   no difference from the staff working in Monoprix here in Paris. Due to the inefficiency, the line is long and moving slowly. The visitors are friendly if they are not from Paris but unfortunately there are many  Parisians . Once I overheard a French telling a lady to get out of the park because it is belong to France and the American lady with her two younger girls who were standing next to him watching parades taking too much space and he was not able to stretch. Well, it is Disney so it is still can be fun but it is in Paris so  people's attitude  is always an issue.. Keep your expectation low so you may find some happiness... If you have been to Florida disney   like us   Keep 20% expectation then you will be OK.",0
3944,"This might reminds you for our good old time but trust me, major attractions are catered for kids. The rides are slow and colorful which makes your kids gonna love it so much. Our real good times only at the souvenir shops",0
21879,"During a recent trip to Disneyland for the most part it was a good experience with the exception of a few park personnel. Parade director were rude, almost to the point of pushy, and at the area where kids can be scanned and armored like Iron Man the attendant was very abrupt, the start of the line was unmarked and those in line were sitting on the floor for how slow things were going.Also, for having to pay almost 100 a person to get in the park, 52 dollars for 3 people to eat (a sandwich and doodle salad) is a bit high.",0
6688,"Ok, I know, it is Disneyland and it is meant to be sweet. And it was my idea to go   the three of us 62 year olds in our second childhood mode.But by the end of the day it was just saccharine overload and I was glad to get out. Getting there is easy, even though it is far from the centre of Hong Kong   take the train, cheap and simple, fast and efficient. And you can book tickets online and redeem them at a separate section at the gate.At first it is all lovely   and it *is* very clean and well done. But I am afraid after a while I found it cloying, the rides for the most part uninspiring and, at times, tacky (and our  guide  on the jungle river cruise was loud and unintelligible   Irrawaddy Irma might as well have spoken in Burmese for all we could hear), and the total overload of trinket and souvenir sales outlets, from the vast emporium right at the gate to little stalls and carts everywhere else, just left the impression the place was out to drain you of every dollar you had on you, or in your card.Food outlets were mostly fast food type and poor quality. We ate at the River View, one of the few sit down restaurants, and it was adequate but not great.Is it good for kids? Yes, and if you have kids and are in Hong Kong you simply must take them. Am I glad I went, yes, but rather so I know not to go again unless I am with people that *do* have kids to take along. Maybe I am not just the right temperament.If I was a child I'd rate it excellent, no doubt, but as a 60  adult, it was just ok and I would not race back, sorry.",0
9073,"Dont take a tour an get dropped there for the whole day ,3hrs is enough ,try go out of season holiday period you will wait up to 45 min per ride .",0
29881,"For our family of 4 we chose 3 day Disney passes and accommodation via AirBnB   we found a bargain 7 night stay in an elegant family apartment in a close by village for   500. Wow! We took food, sweets and drinks into the park to cut costs and ate 1 meal at Disney each day. Good points:  fountains, flowerbeds, topiary, trees and natural wood and rocks made the park feel like a beautiful garden in places   well done for a top effort on the good maintenance and upkeep, including some immaculate toilets (mostly).OK (ish) points:  The parade was good; costumes, dancers and floats were impressive but we needed to sit on a kerbside about 40 mins before it started.   Princess show was good but why so many vocals on the backing track   more princesses should sing, only 2 performers actually sang!  Illuminations were impressive but no decent view points and it was very late at 11pm so we had to leave part way through and watch it on UTube the next day!   Marvel show had impressive projections and stage sets but the waiting time was so long and we should   ve been allowed inside the theatre earlier. Bad points:  Overpricing of everything! Immoral maybe even?!!!   Parking was expensive at 25    each day. Why?!  Some of the car park moving walkways weren   t working.   We felt unsafe walking past the train station.   No signage anywhere in the park!   Lengthy queues everywhere   the fast passes were only useful if you got to the park early.   Hardly any rides in Adventureland and not that many elsewhere for small children.  Some rides were based on dated themes.   Some rides started with lots of empty seats.   Old fashioned staff uniforms instead of something modern that the staff can be proud to wear.  The    app    didn   t work sometimes so it wasn   t that useful for us; the show times and queue waiting times were all incorrect and it wasn   t obvious how to book the meet    n    greet slots.   Lots of junk food.   Couldn   t book a table at Planet Hollywood so we had to wait over 30 mins. Cold pulled pork and chips was sent back then the waitress forgot that the order was with no pickles so the next one went back too. Tortillas were not served sizzling and the peppers and onions were actually still raw! All in all we have enjoyed the holiday but not sure if we will come again. the park needs more rides   and ones that can seat many people so the queues go down quicker. ",0
33071,We had a good time in disneyland paris. weather was kind. start off 2 ahead of others by using extra magic hours. extreme space mountain... big thunder mountain was closed and naturally makes other rides more busy. peak hour waiting can be  2 hours! buzz light year ride was good fun. By 8pm few of the good restaurants are closed. parade is a must do. fire works was more of a show.,0
36906,"We expected something more and something new since our last visit. For our children 5&6 years old it was a dream come true ,but for us it was a little disappointing since we felt that the park has been left like it was before 15 years ago",0
36905,"Disneyland Paris is rather average unfortunately. The rides are for the most part good, but some are in need of refurbishment, or a complete rebuild. It's also quite regularly messy, and people seem to like using the caves near Pirates of the Caribbean as a toilet, so the smell in there can be awful. Also the ticket prices are very high considering the above. Worth a visit, but not necessarily a repeat visit! ",0
29883,"Hence, I can sum up that it did not leave any good or bad impact on me except that I got to spend time on the rides with my son and daughter. We actually went in March 2017. Perhaps the one part that was memorable: I finally regained my fear of being on a rollercoaster mainly because the technical problems they had that day. Since we had already queued for almost an hour for the particular roller coaster I decided to calm my nerves, got on the ride and just screamed at the top of my lungs!",0
33072,"  far too comercial, it is not 'in' theese days, it will bunkrupt during next 10 20 years  admission and everything inside is too expensive  too crowded  long queues for train  lot of expensive and rubish food  not for adults, too boring  not worth visiti",0
36902,"My family are all huge fans of Disney. We've been to WDW resorts, watch the films, and have come to expect quite a lot from the brand when it comes to quality. While my children and I had a good time, it was almost in spite of the cast members and the overall upkeep of the Disneyland Paris park.I can't fault the park itself for long queues. I can, however, fault them for dingy rides that desperately need a fresh coat of paint. The entirety of Frontier Land reeked of garbage water. Cast members wandered about in packs, chatting amongst themselves totally disinterested in the guests (which would get them fired in WDW). Trash wasn't picked up, fountains were dirty, and the whole park had an overall  tired  feel to it.One of the daily parades broke down (I know, things happen) and it took nearly an hour to get it back up and running again. That's ridiculous. I know I keep making comparisons to WDW, but it cannot be helped. WDW would have had things up and running in minutes. It just seems that Disneyland Paris really doesn't care about creating a magical atmosphere. Disney Paris is just another amusement park that happens to have Mickey Mouse.With that said, it *is* still Disney. My children had a marvelous time, we met plenty of characters (MAKE RESERVATIONS and DOUBLE CHECK), and most of the rides were up and running when we were there. Cast members, for the most part, were polite. There was plenty to do and the children were absolutely charmed by the scenery, topiaries, characters, rides, and parades. Their joy was enough to keep me motivated for the duration of our trip.",0
36901,"just returned from 5 days in Disneyland paris we were slightly dissappointed so many of the rides were either broken down or being revamped it was a ridiculous we went 5 times over 4 days to get a ride on the thunder mountain as was broken that much , the crushers coaster was broken a few times too the haunted mansion broke down 3 times whilst we were on the ride a lot of discoveryland was being renovated so shut down for a few mths the park looked tired and definitely needs a face lift, it needs some newer rides etc there is only a few fast rides so really only suited for under 12's if you like fast rides the best rides for this were in the studio. the prices are crazy for poor quality food , soft drinks are 4.50 euro. we paid 17 euro for a cheese pizza nothing else with it hotel charged me 33 euro so over   30 for cheese sandwich , chicken sandwich that was processed chicken and a few crisps and 2 lemonades I nearly fell over , total rip off , you don't mind paying if the quality was there but it wasn't. we stayed at the sequoia lodge it was quite nice rooms was clean and big, 15 mins walk to studio area we were happy with the hotel. over all it was ok but I wouldn't go back the rides were poor and daughter preferred alton tower rides. you are just paying to see the Disney characters really",0
29885,"Where do I start, filthy, smelly, dirty etc. Food appalling, service pathetic, ignorant and frankly nasty staff. Meal plan, waste of money and time, 2 hour queue just for food, horrible cold food with a pathetic choice.

This is NOT Disney. Pathetically run franchise.",0
36899,"We travelled to Disneyland Paris with Newmarket Holidays and it was the worst trip of our lives. I telephoned their office to check arrival times and to inform them we were traveling with a disabled child. They informed us we would arrive by 8pm.Shortly after midnight, we eventually arrived only to discover that they had failed to inform the hotel of our requirements and we were confronted with a flight of step concrete outside stairs leading to our first floor room with no lift. I returned to reception only to discover the rep had vanished and the hotel were unable to move us as they were full. Eventually after hauling wheelchair, luggage and child up stairs we got to bed at 1:30am before having to be up again at 6am for the 7am sitting they had booked us on for breakfast (giving our 6 year old 4.5 hours sleep before a full day in Disneyland) Consequently our child who had spent months looking forward to his trip to Disneyland was tired, scrotty and bad tempered, was too exhausted to enjoy his day and missed all the evening entertainment as he fell asleep at 6pm.On return I complained to Newmarket who had no compassion, informed me they thought 6 hours sleep was adequate for a child of 6 and refused to help further. Newmarket Holidays should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for taking 3 months hard saved Disability Living Allowance from a 6 year old, letting him down horrendously and spoiling his much anticipated trip. I will never travel with such an awful company ever again. The way they treat disabled people then refuse to accept responsibility for their actions is disgusting.",0
15838,"We have been t Disney many times and are firm fans, this was our first family visit to Disneyland California. We stayed in Paradise pier a disney hotel wish was average and very expensive, but hey we thought we would be on site close to the parks and have the privileged magic hour in the morning. Unfortunately as we only wanted a two day pass we were not eligible for the magic hour! We arrived early to take the monorail to the gate, but hey it wasn't working that day, or the next day, so we walked, no problem except it was quite a long way from paradise pier to the gates twice a day (we opted for a midday break back at the hotel pool) with two you children (aged 6 and 8) I was wearing a pedometer we walked over 10 miles both days in the parks!But never mind we don't mind a walk, we did mind the amount of rides that were not working though, the park was busy the lines were long, we arrived at The starters ride, but it was temporarily out of action, we went over to Buzz, the kids loved it, but the queue was long for early am, we then went to book the Jedi experience, but it was full, (10am) so we headed for atop, but it was closed for refurbishment as was the steam boat, and another part of the park, but it was also closed. We headed back and opted for the less popular younger rides, we got to the front of Roger Rabbit after 30 mins, but it got closed temporarily due to a problem, so we went through to a small world but the wait was over an hour, so onto the carousel, but it got closed as we joined the queue, across the way we joined the queue to something else, but this got closed too! by this point the kids were getting upset we had been in the park over two hours and been on one ride.It was a hot day so we said never mind lets have an ice cream, we ordered four but Enrique must have miss heard me and gave us three, one which we did not want, I apologised an asked for it to be changed and another added, and for the first time in all my experience of Disney an employee was rude to me, criticising me for changing my order, which I had not done. By this point I had had enough! We got the kids ice creams and walk them back up main street, to guest services, I was going to complain, (it takes a lot for me to get to this point) Once again we had to join a queue, even to complain!! After a few moments we spoke to a pleasant member of staff, she said we could have a refund or a few fast passes, we had travelled all the way from the UK, having booked our trip 6 months earlier, we did not know that so many things would be closed for refurb at the time, but even allowing for this we did not expect to line up so many time to then be told the ride was temporarily suspended. We went back to the hotel had a swim and some food and returned later on, to try again, but by this point the queues were still long and other things had closed, albeit temporarily, this time it was the haunted house, the queue to see mickey and minnie were still 60 minutes, and even with the fast passes we were all quickly loosing the will to continue. We returned to the hotel tired and fed up. A very sad day day, as the Magic had gone! An expensive dissapointing and miserable day.",0
36897,"Visited this place along with my kids and other family.

13937,"Don't get me wrong; at 62 I am a Disney fanatic and I have been since I first went at the age of 23! Having said that I must admit that the current construction has made it very difficult to get from one place to another. Losing the back way from Frontierland to Fantasyland and having the railroad shut down has pushed a lot of traffic back into the heart of the park. This made it feel as busy as it has ever been even though the DLR app rated our days there as 2 4 out of 10. It is especially bad when there are parades since the only way to move around pushes you back through the center of the park.In addition I have never had so many rides shutdown for maintenance throughout the day. I really felt like we did not receive the value for the amount we paid to get into the park. I would hope that Disney would reduce their prices during this time so you get a more fair value for what you pay to get in (I know, I'm dreaming).California Adventure was fine and we had none of the problems we experienced in Disneyland.Obviously I will return to Disneyland, but probably not until a year after the current construction is finished. I imagine that first year after the new land opens is going to be packed!",0
3980,"Having been to California Disney many times, Hong Kong pales in comparison by far. Fewer rides, different vibe, awful food. If you have time and want to spend the money, go. Just know what you're in for. We struggled to find enough to do for 5 hours, rode a few rides multiple times even, and were done. We went in November when the weather was decent and found it warm. Cannot imagine going in the heat, let alone with children. ",0
21910,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan who's dragged my family to Disneyland once (sometimes twice) a year for the last 25 years. Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why wouldn't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere. Overall, it was a disappointing trip, and the entire family concluded that we did not need to visit there again anytime soon.",0

15798,"I have five members to my family and paying for D land is like having to leave them my first born. Way to expensive for us all to go. However, it was my son's B.day and he has never been to this theme park, so he and my husband went for a day of fun. They had an ok time, and would have had a better one if stuff was actually operational. My beef is with their greediness. ALOT of their rides were closed and yet they still charged full price for entry. Hmmmm how is it that we have to pay the same as someone who previously got to go on these rides but they are not made available to us for the same cost? The least they could have done is offer a two for one park pass at the cost of one park at least until all their stuff is operational again. It's too much $$$ for what you get now. Walt would not be so greedy.....I think I'll stick to Knott's Berry Farm. Good prices and they have rides you can actually go on.",0
36808,"Now this should have been a 5 star review because as a park it's great. The only problem and it's a big problem is the lack of characters to meet. One you've seen the four at the entrance (with massive ques to meet them) then that's it basically. The odd one dotted about the place with massive waits to meet them. It really is a big let down. They do a thing called stars in cars which is the most unorganized pile of c4!p I've ever witnessed. Fully grown adults pushing kids out of the way to see people dressed up, it's an absolute joke. My lad got 5 autographs in 3 days. The characters should be everywhere, always interacting with the kids. Sort this out and it would be amazing. ",0
36809,"We have recently got back from a 5 day, 4 night break in DLP. We stopped at the Davy Crockett Ranch which I was pleased with but I will write a separate review for that. This review is for DLP. We are a family of 7, consisting of 2 adults & 5 kids aged 11, 10, 8, 6 and 2. It was half term so I expected it to be busy, but I did not expect the queues to ruin my time there. They were a nightmare. Queueing for 30 minutes is bad enough but lots of them were for 70 minutes! It states clearly at the beginning of the ride how long you will have to wait, but they have a clever strategy of hiding how long the queue is as most of it is concealed from view. My husband said he felt like Homer Simpson as every time he thought he was nearing the end DOH, turn the corner and there is another mile of queue! My 2 year old was a nightmare waiting as you can't constrain them in a buggy as you have to leave the buggy outside of the ride so he kept trying to run off. My other kids would get bored too, and would end up bickering with each other or climbing on the barriers (which you are not allowed to do). Tip   any electrical hand held device that you have, please take, it will help alleviate boredom and keep Mom & Dad from losing the plot! We paid for the half board option and I am so glad that we did as we would have spent a fortune otherwise. We did not spend hardly any money as I refuse to be conned by the extortionate prices that they charge for food, drinks, toys, clothes etc. We just took packed lunches into the park, with drinks and sat and had our lunch in one of the many picnic areas. I told the kids that if there was anything they wanted to buy, take a picture and I'll have a look on Amazon when I get back home for a 3rd of the price. Unsurprisingly there was nothing that they were desperate to get! The food in the restaurants was lovely. Plenty to choose from and a good variety. Although don't get choosing Billy Bobs, we went there the one night and we had to queue for about 30 minutes just to be seated. I booked my restaurant reservations before I went which I would recommend.The 5pm Parade is fun but the crowds ruin it for me. I was stressed out keeping an eye on all my children. Also, when it finishes, getting out of the park is a nightmare as everyone else is doing it to. The night time parade is fantastic. The castle being lit up with fireworks is wonderful, but again, it is so busy, getting a decent place to view it is hard work.I preferred Disney Studios to the park as I enjoyed the shows. The car stunt show was brilliant. Also, the timings for the various shows usually meant that you didn't have to queue for too long.There were a couple of parks but they were closed. This was disappointing as this would have given my husband and I a bit of chilling out time whilst the kids let off some steam (I have all boys who have lots of energy), as they were getting cheesed off with queueing. We used the free  magic hours , but everyone seemed to as well. Yes, it's quieter than midday, but still, you are looking at about 30 minute wait, if not more. We also used the free pass, but sometimes the queue to even get the free pass was ridiculous.Overall I'm glad we went as it was an experience but this was not a holiday for me it was more of a military mission. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had 1 or 2 children, but as my husband said, it would test the relationship of even the strongest of couples. Would I go back? No chance. Would I spend a fortune going to Florida? No. Give me a holiday where the kids have freedom to run about rather than being constrained to a queue and I can chill out, then I'm happy! I can safely say we won't be visiting another theme park for a long time!",0
36810,"We have been, some years ago, to the Florida Disney park and Universal studios. The atmosphere was magical, but no so here, in Paris. There is so much walking....ridiculous lengths of queuing, and more disney souvenir shops than you can shake a stick at. The magic doesn't exist here. It's mostly concrete and jaded painted facades. The souvenir shops are ridiculously expensive, and there is one on every corner. It is already very expensive to take children to this park, but it is difficult, especially with small children, to have to say  no  so many times if the money is limited. Happily, my grandchildren had saved up their own pocket money, although I was not impressed with how little it would get them. They had a good time, as all children will given some rides and new things to see, but the waiting times were way too long, the distances way too far, and with bad weather to boot, it was hard to enjoy it all in a fun manner. I wouldn't go again, although I did take them on a day trip to Paris which was by far the best day. My message to Disney...........get your act together and thrill the kids properly! My message to others, if you must go, make sure you have plenty of money with you.",0
36811,not a scratch on Disney world were everything is possible and staff are smiley and polite.  This place was the opposite which is probably why we did't see any Americans.,0
21934,"Took our grandson for the 1st time, he's 5. I was really surprised at the lack of Disney characters that we did not see walking around in the park. Food is so so over priced there. Our grandson still had an awesome time but he so wanted to see Buzz light year & never did. Only got to get 9 autographs of Disney characters. Disappointed!!!",0
31502,"I visited Disneyland Paris from August 7 to August 11. The park has great attractions, and although it's smaller than the Orland facility, it does have very fun games. Waiting times are much better than Orlando's; on average we waited for 20 minutes, except for a couple of atttractions where our max waiting time was 75 minutes. My only big complaint is that we rented a stroller at Disneyland Paris and it was stolen at our first attraction. For the hefty 20 dollar tag on the rental stroller I would expect a more sophisticated system to identify strollers. At the rental facility they give you a piece of paper where you write down the toddler's name and rhen you place it in a plastich pouch. We later found out that this piece of paper can easily be taken out of the pouch and then it's impossible to find your stroller back. Disneyland Paris, you can do better than that!!! I highly discourage renting strollers here!!",0
3982,As if you love Disney Movie definitely Disneyland will be one of your top destination. Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small but well enough to feel the magical world. Most of the rides are very gentle means only good for kids and people who don't like thrill rides.A great place to take photos since they have few themes on every area as Disneyland always do but too bad their castle not 100% real because some part only a picture so it wasn't really amusing at all for me. And for better deal you can actually check KLOOK apps to get cheaper ticket for Disneyland.,0
36815,"Was a great Disney park when it opened under the name EuroDisney. Went when it was 3 months old and was dead to the world.Alas it's not got better with age. Queues galore, no characters walking around (yet you can buy autograph books?), messy toilets, flakey paint work and just unhappy staff.It was so great but it's just been forgotten. The rides are fantastic but the Qs put you in a bad mood.The staff seem annoyed too. You say please and thank you in French and get nothing back.One Italian family in front of us got annoyed with one staff member as they asked them a question in English just to get told rudely he didn't speak English? They told me they were shocked how a international park doesn't have English speaking staff.The other grumble is the shops. Every exit your in a shop and you be broke if you don't be tough and say no to disappointed kids.You can't beat the thrills of the rides. Some show age and forgotten the original architects plans so things are obscured from view now like on the train.It's still a great place to go for the magic but it's not as good as say Disneyland Hong Kong.",0
36817,"Well I visited this place and had much higher expectations prior to arriving.You do walk into another world when you visit this place but to be it felt more like paying to enter a shopping centre full of cafe's, restaurants and merchandise! The cost also is excessive. We should have purchased online though it was a last minute decision and online booking can not be made for the same day so we paid at the gate, for 2 adults was about 160  euros (2 park entrance).There was one particular thing the little kid in me wanted to do and that was to visit Micky! We entered the place where you line up. After 10 mins of waiting without really any movement we asked how long it would take and was told about 50 minutes. I just didn't want to wait this long, the day was cold, long and drawn out at this place. If 50 minutes is normal wait during school term I can only imagine what the wait is in holidays!Anyway really I didn't know what I was going to expect but growing up the idea of disney land was wild and I didn't go. Now I have gone, maybe it would have been a bit better if I was a kid! :( I would never return to this place again myself and wife.Though if when I have kids I would take them for the experience I think they would enjoy it!My wife had fun here (25) so that's what counts really for me :)",0
36818,"Disneyland really is showing it's age. Very tired and out dated   the Michael Jackson 3D show is just laughable. Sure 30 years ago it would have been impressive but now it just looks sad.The biggest problem is the greed of the company. You have to queue for 60 minutes to ride a tame, middle of the road ride. Food and drinks are ridiculous   we paid    20 for 2 milkshakes.Expect to be ripped off by the mouse. ",0
29916,It has been a while since we went to Disney Paris. We always liked it there. But it has changed. Too much people.. it was too crowded? Should be an entrance stop. The waiting times were almost all above an hour. That is not normal anymore. We won't come again. The disney magic is not there anymore and it has become very expensive.,0
36820,"We took our 5 year old daughter for a 4 day trip to Disneyland Paris. She did enjoy it, but even she found the queuing challenging. 2 hours plus to see the Princess Palace and average ques of 1 & 1 2 hours for most other rides was common place. The costs are extremely high for food and drink and the quality extremely poor. 14 euros for a hot dog (cold) & fries plus long waits even though the ques seemed manageable. Queueing for car park entry, queuing for bag search, queuing for entry to the park and queuing for just about everything. On our last day we only managed one attraction and lunch. The rest was   you guessed it   Queuing! Even the 5 year old complained 'but we've only done one thing!'We saw no characters walking around the park in the four days we spent there.The park was clean ish but most alarming was the fact that the car parks were not illuminated at night. Maybe 10,000   cars and families walking around in the pitch black did not feel very safe and an accident waiting to happen. There were lights installed but not switched on. Shame on you Disney!On the plus side the parade was good   but far from great. The night time illumination and fire works were great and almost worth waiting for. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was excellent fun.in Summary if you enjoy queuing and spending extortionate amounts of money of awful food then this is the place for you! Advise: If you can then save for Florida as there is no way an American audience would put up with the horror that is Disneyland Paris.",0
4006,The park is small and some great rides closed in the limited number of rides that they have. The biggest thing missing in the park is the not so friendly staff missing the expected Disney smile and courtesy be it the ride operators or folks in the restaurants. Not recommended if you are a big fan of the  Happiest place on Earth  way of functioning of US Disney parks which they take literally ,0
4013,"Plan your visit time carefully as this park can get really crowded. We tried to visit on other occasions but the line at the entrance was too daunting. We ended up going on a slightly rainy Saturday, and the lines were not bad at all. If you have never been to Disneyland world before you will have a wonderful time. It is a magical place. I was a little disappointed, though, because it was lacking some of iconic rides from Disney World in Orlando and Disneyland in Anaheim such as the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean. It is small in comparison to the other Disney parks including Tokyo Disney but still has the basics you would expect such as the castle, the parades, Space Mountain, etc.",0
12327,"You have to plan on waiting in LONG, LONG, LONGGGG lines but it is still fun. My kids had fun but I am not sure it was the best use of that much money. We were there for 13 hours and did not make it to as many rides or attractions as I had hoped. You have to get the fast pass ($10 extra ticket) it will save you some waiting without it, you will never make the rides.We ate at bear country something and the burgers and fries were warm at best. Red Rose Inn had much better food and was less expensive",0
36804,"We visited here with our young son in between Christmas and New Year and I can say it was the most disappointing experience of my son's young life. 80 minute queue to meet Mickey Mouse?!?! Shortest ride queue of 70 minutes! Some rides had queues of over 130 minutes. We where told to pay for a  fast pass ... Having spent   150 on tickets, I would think we had paid enough. We got on one ride, saw one small parade and we left as you could not get any food without a horrific queue. I visited here back in 1997 and it is seriously in need of vast improvement. Characters should walk about the park. You should NOT have to queue to see Mickey Mouse. Do not waste your money coming here!! Save up and go to America. I can only say that I was glad we were based in central Paris and not at Disney itself as I would of gone mad!!! When a 5 year old asks to leave Disney Land as he is bored of queuing, you know it's a terrible experience. We visited nearly two months ago and even now I am so disappointed that my son had his dreams dashed by the greed of Disney! Over sold, over busy!! Do not go!!",0
24131,"I recently moved to SoCal and bought one of the annual passports. My family are fans of Disney and we have have a good time on multiple visits to Orlando and on a Disney cruise. So, when we moved to the greater LA area, we couldn't pass up an annual membership. However, it turns out we have only used our pass a few days this year  barely worth buying the pass. You see, the park itself seems much more crowded than Orlando because it has much of the same rides attractions but they are compressed into a smaller area. In addition, they don't offer the waterparks, which are a nice diversion on hot days in Florida. The kids enjoy visiting, but I can barely tolerate it, so I don't think I'll be renewing my pass next year.",0
21938,"CROWDED. We had a family member who had not been. i dont think i will go back. long wait for rides. for 90.00 per, i would rather  visit knott's berry farm.",0
12329,For a company as sophisticated as Walt Disney you would think they could get better service. It's really bad.,0
36800,"The atmosphere was lovely especially for the grandchildren. However, quite a few of the rides were closed or broken which put more pressure on the rides that were open. I also found it extremely annoying that some families seemed to think it was ok to push their way through to a member who had saved their place in the queue.It just made everything more stressful. Pinocchio and Snow White rides need to be scrapped or totally revamped. It's a Small World was magical   I just wish I could stop singing the song!!!!!",0
36799,"We went during half term from 14th   18th February. We knew it was going to be busy but thought as there was fast pass we could used and also the early entry into the park as we were staying at a disney hotel it would be ok.The ride ques were awful. The new Ratatouille ride and the Crush Rollercoaster were the worst two with ques taking up to 2 hours. It doesn't help when the Crush Rollercoaster breaks down and people have been waiting for ages just beforehand. The fast pass didnt really help. If i got a fast pass at 10am then it would tell us to come back around 12.30   1pm so leaves you hanging around for ages. If you tried to get a fast pass ticket at 12 noon then you would be lucky to get one for 5.30pm but usually by mid day the fast pass was used up and closed for the day.There were quite a few rides breaking down, my husband and sons experienced this on the Aerosmith Roller coaster. After a long que to get on it and they were close to the front then it broke down. Then another time for the Runaway Mine roller coaster they were queuing and it broke down. Phantom Manor broke down and was closed for a morning too when we wanted to go on it.Awfully disappointing. The que times and the rides breaking down were the big thing that made the trip a disappointment. As the hotel was brilliant, the staff at both parks, in restaurants, at the hotel etc... were all brilliant. Both parks were immaculate and clean and i wasn't bothered about the sky high prices of souvenirs or food and drink. I just would have liked the rides to be more reliable and better que times.",0
9042,quite the opposite of the real world! never understood what people see in it!,0
36797,"We waited for almost 2 hours for tickets, there were only 4 people serving. We then waited in another queue to enter the park. A few of the big rides were closed. Lines for rides were well over an he, people everywhere. Food is average and overpriced. Was a good day out if you're a bit Disney obsessed, but probably wouldn't go back again!",0
36796,"We booked our trip through Paris City Vision and caught a bus to and from the park when it opened and just before it closed (which meant we missed the fireworks, bummer). This was our first trip to Disneyland so we were a little unprepared. We hadn't planned our day to ensure we got the most out of the shows and performances. The day we visited wasn't the nicest, there was a little rain throughout the day. Thankfully we didn't have to queue for too long for any of the attractions. A number of rides were closed on the day which was a bit of a disappointment. There were also 2 3 rides that we were unable to go on because the a English commentary (or something) wasn't working. The staff were unable to tell us when to go back so we ended up skipping it all together.Our favourite part of the parks was definitely the Toy Story village where you were the size of a toy, definitely bought back lots of childhood memories. We also enjoyed the story of animation at Disney Studio, they had drawing classes and all sorts of things going on. The parade in the afternoon is well worth sticking around for, especially if you have young children (or if you're a big kid yourself).",0
21941,"I am a DVC member and visit Disneyworld at least once every year or two. I have always found it impeccable. I assumed that would have been the same for Disneyland. Oh, so not true. I recently visited for 2 days. The first day, I went at night around 8:00, since the park didn't close until 12;00, or I thought. It was open but 3 4 of the rides were not running. Many of the restaurants were closed. We went to pizza plaza, and they were closing at 10:00. I entered at 9:45 and you could visibly see the staff was not happy about that. The pizza was cold. Most of the other counter entrees were closed. Most disturbing was the attitudes of the staff. The floor looked like it hadn't been swept all day. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Unfortunately, the staff attitudes are the same among the employees throughout the park. I felt like I was at islands of adventure when schools were taking their trips. Although there were many families there,MIT was overrun with obnocious teenagers and everything was out of control. The cast could care less on the rides while they are part of the experience in Florida. Who was yawning, and who Was yelling at kids not to do certain things seemed to be the run of of the day. We went to California Adventure the following day and found it to be cleaner but that was in the morning, but there was no difference in the cast demeanor. It just felt like they didn't want to be there,It's hard to imagine how different the two resorts are. Save your money and go to Florida.",0
9041,many people save for a lifetime to go to disneyland. dont waste time going to hongkong.in december 2011 there was no waterworld.absolutely boring. nothing much for teens to do or see.waste of my time and money. full of retail stores selling souvenirs of characters.yes sell souvenirs but is that the only attraction. the kids were bored..........11 years 9 years and 16 years old.,0
21943,"After traveling to Disney World eight years in a row, it was time to try Disneyland. I guess I have taken Disney World's customer service for granted. Everyone from food service to janitorial staff is friendly, helpful, and just plain fun. Their focus was always the customer. I did not find this kind of service at Disneyland. The employees typically were bothered that they had to work. When approaching information for help, or ordering a meal, the employees were usually engaged in a conversations between themselves.Disney World remains the Happiest Place to be, Disneyland   not so happy.",0
36792,"This is not a review of the restaurants and hotel, I have done those separately. The park as a whole has some good rides but during our trip we encountered many rude guests and some rude staff. Queuing was disorganised and made more stressful than necessary, with many people pushing in front. When we were stepping off of thunder mountain my partner was grabbed on the shoulder and shoved hard enough to stumble, by a cast member. My partner was merely stepping of the ride as instructed and did not do anything to warrant being physically moved. It has always been my understanding and belief that members of staff, anywhere not just disney, should not physically touch guests outside of character interactions and playful gestures. This also meant that we became separated for a moment as he had been pushed in amongst the other people leaving, leaving me behind. The park could be good if it was not full of rude people. ",0
4022,"As a devout follower of all things Disney, I was disappointed in poor line management, which is not indicative of all other Disney properties.   This was my second visit to the HK Disneyland Park and it was a significant improvement from my 2009 trip.",0

9048,if you've ever been to Disneyland in Anaheim or Disneyworld in Florida you'll be in for a shock at this watered down version of Disneyland that doesn't have many of iconic rides and attractions of the original. The upside is that you can make it around the park in a day   no problem. There's not that much to see. Food is catered to the China visitors.,0
9049,"We were done in Disneyland in 3 hours, rides included. How magical. (We appreciate the lack of queue and crying children.) Considering that it takes some time to get from the city to Disneyland, it doesn't seem that worth it to go at all. Skip this and perhaps try Ocean Park instead.",0

36841,This is the 3rd time we have been to disneyland paris and the first two times we where left feeling so happy we booked again as soon as possible but this time we feel a bit let down there seems to be a lot of cost cutting going on they no longer have the character meet n greets in the hotel lobby's plus I found the food in general was just not upto the standards of our previous visits even the staff in general seemed less helpful very disappointed on the whole ,0
25988,People in wheelchairs and people using canes had to wait in long lines. So we didn't get to do a lot at the park.,0
21912,"Went here after trip across the USA. Having visited Disney world in Florida we were very disappointed with this park in relation to Florida.About a quarter of the size, and the castle is tiny, hence very packed expensive and limited rides and attractions. Only spent 7 hours there as there were not enough interesting things to do.Don't waste the time and money....Spend the airfare and get the full experience.",0
15816,Disneyland very crowded with long waits for rides . Also prices are ridiculous for food and also entry.  In saying that everyone needs to visit Disneyland once in their life.  The night time parade and fireworks was brilliant.,0
36853,"The good; Disney Parade at 17.30 and closing ceremony at end of every day are spectacular. A number of the rides, if you can get on them, are impressive. Interesting to walk around the park.The bad: the queues are horrendous and I speak as a Merlin annual pass holder who frequents Alton Towers and Thorpe Park regularly. My daughter and I visited on a Sunday and Monday in February that we thought would be fairly quiet. How wrong we were. By noon on both days almost all rides had queues of over 30minutes and many over an hour. Our tickets allowed us into the park at 8am, but so did 100's of others and only 7 rides were open so minimum queue time was 35 minutes at least. Free fast track is fine early on but by lunch they were all booked for the rest of the days and therefore no use. Food is fairly expensive but week Euro helped a lot, even after all these years they do fast food very slowly. Having queued 30 minutes for a Ben and Jerry's ice cream (yes in Feb) we just gave up as only 6 people had been served in half an hour.Gifts were very expensive but no different to other theme parks. If you buy one of the themed, very expensive helium filled balloons take a bit of time to make sure the string is firmly attached. Must have seen at least 20 a day float away because strings were not firmly attached with distraught children wondering what had happened.TGV rail fare from CDG airport is hugely expensive,far cheaper is the RER from central Paris and about 45 minutes.Overall enjoyed the experience but peak season must be a nightmare.",0
3986,"It an average place to visit. Not many rides for teenagers. I think not to the standards of US. It disappoints after walking for KMS. Few countable good ones like Grizly Gulch, Space Mountain, Mystic Manor. Thats it. Very costly.",0
9057,"This is definitely not Disney World. It is very small, but worth the experience especially if you are using your Disney Vacation Points, because the park tickets are free if you use your points to stay at the Disney Hotels. Will probably not go back, but definitely glad we went. ",0
36850,"The que for rides can be very large, and their are only a few fast track rides but you can only get 1 fast track ticket at a time which wastes a lot of your time standing in a que and with young kids this can be a bit of a nightmare.",0
13938,"We found some cast members snarky, rude or blatantly uncaring. We encountered swipe issues with our credit card on day two and so spent the trip telling cashiers that it would have to be entered manually as it wasn't swiping. The cast member in pieces of eight gave me a dirty look and asked me why I was bothering to use it. We are from Canada, we have no option to run to the bank and get a new card issued during a 5 day trip, it's just not feasible. Other cast members actually challenged us and said no it wasn't and swiped it about 15 times then tried the plastic bag method. My concern came when the card was actually getting bent as this was unfortunately the only card we had brought with us. The cashier at the pin store called for a manager and they came and tried another pos machine. She swipes it a dozen or more times while telling us that of course it would work. Then loudly announces it was declined. I have a minor heart attack at this as I was monitoring our spending and we were no where near our limit. She swipes it and Murphy's law the damn thing works and goes through. No apologies, just see I told you so (literally). I was honestly unimpressed and at that point was so frustrated that I said forget it I'm done took my bag and said that I was not happy and explain I was supposed to be taking a customer service course with Disney next year but was reconsidering based on in park experiences. She congratulated me at getting a job with Disney. I explain I wasn't working for Disney, I love my job. I was done and the last comment was most likely really rude but at that point I didn't care. Disney needs to spend more money on cit a hug and re educating their service staff or lose their reputation",0
21916,"Disneyland is a wonderful place, can get a little crowded at times. Plan your trip during the week for less of a crowd. Ride the rides during parades and shows to see more of the ride aspect of the park. It is becoming less and less desirable with the large number of crowds and the constant price increases. We have annual passports, which have a lot of perks, but the added crowds are making us reconsider.",0
36847,I'm not sure what I was expecting when we went. I have been many times in Florida. I was hoping it would have been a little different but they had all of the same rides and nothing was special about this location.,0
36845,"The park appeared more surprised than us that it was French holidays, the shuttle buses cramped One night especially was a nightmare, amazing that no one was hurt, kids getting crushed in mad rushed to get in buses, parents screaming and fighting,awful. Space mountain and nautilus closed for refurb, star tours massive disappointment especially considering how long we queued. Big thunder mountain closed while we were queue and never re opened. Indiana jones was fun as was the closing fireworks show, but overall pretty poor value for money.",0
36844,"Just returned from Paris. Where do I start . Sat nav does not take you to the ranch instead to a dead end to a padlocked gate. Asked the locals if they knew where the ranch was. Reply no Idea. After 45 minutes driving in circles eventually found the signs to the parks. Followed signs and some guess work we eventually found the ranch. Now it's very late the family and I are very tired after a long drive from London. Checked into our cabin which really was a glorified caravan. We were situated in the middle of the woods which was very cold and wet. After we had settled in we went to the ranch tavern to have our evening meal. This was a buffet which was o.k. Following morning breakfast which wasn't a buffet but you go to a hut to collect bread,tea,milk so you take it back to your cabin and make it yourself. We had the impression that the breafast was a buffet. This was not the case. So to put it in a nut shell this was awful.The both parks we're run down and needed some work doing. Everything was over priced. Come on Disney get your act together. I felt ripped off. The kids did not enjoy this nor did the wife. To summarise Paris has let themselves down and need to do something about this asap. Good luck if you decide to go here.",0
21918,"Of course I'm a huge disney fan and love Disneyland! It's such a magical place and brings the kid in you. However, I do feel over the years some things have changed not for the good. The prices are high and some of the customer service wasn't that great. I did have mostly good customer service encounters but there were some incidents not. However, some changed for the better like higher technology on the rides and the imagination that the imagineers have is really amazing. I would recommend it but to those who went when they were young in the 60s when the park first opened be prepared how different it is. I hope to go again soon!",0
3992,"I had very high expectations based on visiting Disneyland in California when I was about 8yrs old. I must say, I certainly viewed Disneyland differently as a child. Don't get me wrong, we had a fun day. We went on a couple of rides (fairly mild imo).The souvenirs were expensive, but that is kind of expected at this type of attraction. If you have kids, for sure take them there. If your a Disney fan, you really can't miss it. If you have the afternoon and a couple thousand kh$ to kill, than by all means check it out. ",0
29905,"Seems that scammers in the form of teenagers actually prey on tourists going to Disneyland Paris at train stations, offering to help purchase tickets. You arrive at Disney and realise that you actually bought a kids ticket (you will not understand anything 'cos everything is in French) and have to pay a penalty of more than 30 Euros pax to get out of the station. This is a real bummer for many tourists. The park itself was average with the usual rides, the area is bigger than the Hong Kong park but crowded and everything was in French. Happy that I managed to see my favourite Chip and Dale though!",0
36825,"We visited Disney Paris from the 18th 20th February which was half term. We were a party of five adults and two children 5 8. The children thought it was magical when they stepped inside the park and they really enjoyed their stay. However, we did have a few gripes. This was Paris in February and we did expect it to be cold but the thing that made it worse was the queues. The waiting times for some attractkons were 120 180 minutes. Attractions are only open for limited times rather than all day so queues are inevitable and Goodness knows how long you would have to wait in the busy months.A disappointment was the fact that the Disney characters were not walking around mingling with the crowds as they do in America. Even to get their autograph books signed the children had to join yet more queues. Even on the one occasion when my grand daughter encountered Cinderella (her then favourites princess) in the street she was dismissed with a wave of her hand. My grand daughter now tells her friends she was blanked by Cinderella. Not very magical! We did find some other members of staff to be unfriendly and surly. It is not a good idea to buy food in the park. After looking for somewhere to eat we arrived at a place where we bought seven hot dogs and soft drinks which cost in excess of 100 euros. The cost would not be an issue if it was matched by quality, but it certainly was not. Once we had bought the food there was nowhere to sit and people were scrabbling for tables and falling out. My advice is to take your own food.Having said all that, we had a magical time and the children loved it. The parade in the afternoon was particularly well done and all the characters took part. We would certainly visit again. It is a good idea to research the attractions you want to see prior to visiting Disney and head straight for them when you arrive as this might minimise the waiting times.",0
9054,"This Disneyland are full with some disgusting people.There is no LINE between all these people and we have to wait for every ride as far as 40 minutes to 1 hour to get a ride , and the wait is not WORTH it than a ride for 40 SECOND and about the MAXIM restaurant inside the Disneyland are THE WORST, THE BADDEST, THE YUCKIEST, THE JERKIEST, THE RIPPEST MONEY from all of my experience restaurant EVERRR!!!!I don't think I will go back in my life to this restaurant and I am regret to eat at this restaurant with almost 500 HK$ for NO TASTE NOODLE, and for 9 pcs BBQ pork skin, and 12 pcs BBQ PIG, and the Shrimp Ball order was came with no Fresh Shrimp taste at All, The Shrimp Ball was smells not right, and their bill come with 10 % service chargewith NO SERVICE AT ALLLL!!!! Horrible... and I will not be back...sorry that's not my good experience..",0
3995,With what I would class as only 2 major rides not a great deal to keep older children occupied. Everything you expect from Disney  including characters and parades (unless it's raining) Overall a bit of a let down especially for those with US Disney experience.,0
9053,"Why else would the food be so disgusting? I had a bowl of Japanese noodles that cost twice what it would have costed outside of disney, but tasted like a bowl of instant noodles with too much MSG (imagine that). The burger was like cardboard and the fries were from a few days ago (or maybe it was just a special flavor). The smoke Turkey leg was dug out of the back of a storage room left forgotten since grandpa was a lad.Disneys in the US and Paris both offer decent food. Not sure what happened to Disney in HK. We left only after the fireworks, so we were all starving. But we would rather starve then eat the crappy food at Disney!!! Why does it have to be a lose lose situation? Give me reasonable food, then Disney can make money and I can leave with a full tummy!",0
36836,"We stayed in the New York for 4 days which was good for a family of 4, only gripe about the room was there was no tea coffee making facilities. Food   you expect to pay a premium but felt their pricing verges on profiteering, so on an evening we ventured out to get some value   plenty of good local restaurants if you have come by car   one particularly good French one we found was in Chessy village, only 2 miles from the resort. (Le Table)Parks   having visited both Disney parks in the states previously we were left under whelmed by the Paris one, it just didn't run as slick or have the panache, from the chaos queuing for the rides to the lack of communication when rides were shut, my advice would be to save up and go to the states.",0
24134,"I went there once and I was less than impressed. I did get to see many of the characters, but I am not really into that anymore and was more interested in the rides but the lines are long (to be expected).The entry fee is super high and food in there is expensive (even bottled water).Take your kids, but save $$ so you can afford all the things they might ask for.",0
36834,"Just got back from spending four days in Euro Disney and although I do acknowledge it was during school holidays, I was left disappointed and underwhelmed with the Disney experience especially with the amount of queuing. I have been a few times before, but a number of years ago, but boy has the place gone downhill. We spent four days queuing, often in queues that are badly managed with people pushing in (sorry, but quite often they are French) for rides that had 'technical' problems and regardless of how long you have been queuing, you are just told to come back later   after queuing for two hours for the Turtle ride, we were lucky that someone translated the announcement that the ride was being closed due to technical issues   hard to explain to an 5 and 8 year old after queuing for almost 2 hours for nothing! It probably didn't help that a number of rides were closed for refurbishment or maintenance, this just added pressure on the remaining rides. There wasn't adequate food outlets and we saw a number of kiosks closed even though there was massive queues. Be prepared to queue, queue and queue, including also having pictures taken with any characters, for a table at any of the restaurants off the park and pretty much queuing for large amounts of your day! You associate Disney as providing excellent levels of service, most of their staff need to be reminder of this (not all, but quite a few), I was even barged out of the way but one member of staff who was clearly not happy and in a rush. The park is in need of money being spent on it, some areas looked tired and water features etc were not working, there was also a fair amount of rubbish in some areas. Used to be such a magical experience and you would have thought Disney would know how to manage high volumes of people or perhaps they don't care   perhaps someone from Disney should visit as a paying customer and not as a VIP, they could be quite shocked!",0
29909,"So this was our first visit to Disneyland Paris although we have visited all the parks in Florida before so knew what to expect.We booked 1 day tickets at   56 per person through the Disney App whilst already in France which was easy and a significant saving on the    99 on the gate price. The tickets were valid for any single date for the next few months.The tickets state that they must be printed however we did not have access to a printer so downloaded each one to a mobile phone which worked absolutely fine.You scan your ticket on entry and can then use it at a fastpass booth to generate your first fastpass. I would suggest going for Peter Pan or Big Thunder Mountain first as these were the ones that ran out on the day we were there (once all the fast passes are gone they close the machines down).You then have to wait until either you have used your fastpass or 2 hours (whichever is sooner) before you can generate your next fastpass. Again you just need to scan your ticket or phone however you must do this as the actual ride you want the fastpass for which is a real pain.We managed to get round most of the rides but you do need to plan your fast passes in advance   which rides are the most important to you.The fastpass system is adequate but no where near as efficient as the app based system in Florida. The park itself is good and we had a good time, there was lots of queuing and walking as you would expect but most of the rides were great. Loved Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Caribbean, It   s a Small World and Space Mountain. Beware of 1.4m height restriction on Indiana Jones.You can take as much food and water with you as you can which I would recommend you do as food and drink prices are absolutely extortionate and the queues are very long.Overall we had a good time but wish we had done this before Florida as it doesn   t come anywhere near up to scratch and so we ended up feeling quite underwhelmed.

36832,"We last visited just over a decade ago as a family of four, both in summer and winter (three days) and had a brilliant time. We have since visited Disneyland California   2010   and it certainly didn't disappoint. This time we hoped to recapture some of the magic when we visited for the day during a short Paris break, with just our younger son, aged 13. The day was no disaster, but standards had declined so dramatically since we were last here that I left feeling rather let down. We did both parks   Studios as well. On the plus side, the Animagique show was just as good as I remembered. My wife enjoyed Cinemagique while me and our son joined a queue. The Hollywood Tower Hotel was great and went some way to redeeming things. But otherwise? The park appeared tatty and dirty in places; I tripped on a large crack in the pavement. Statues were covered in bird droppings. Seats in the Cinemagique auditorium were broken and cracked. Space Mountain was shut, as was something starring Michael Jackson   so not too sad about that! The Aerosmith ride was working, but lost atmosphere as the sound system had failed. The studio tour was a bit sad: queue over an hour; some of the coaches were defective; the same video we remembered from years ago with Jeremy Irons (seriously?!?) was still being used and, whilst the canyon truck thing is still quite enjoyable, the set from the Reign of Fire felt antiquated and irrelevant; the vehicles supposedly used in films were dirty and rusting away giving the impression we were on a tour of a scrapyard rather than a film set. Long queues for Indiana Jones which was OK when we got to it. The biggest let down was the food. There was a dire shortage of accesible  functioning places to eat. We found ourselves in a desperate crush for fast food served up by hassled staff and which was overpriced, soggy (fries) and stale (burgers)   then there was nowhere to sit and eat it. There were families sitting on a crowded, sticky, unswept floor, children crying, their parents' stress palpable. Awful. Later I joined a queue at an outside concession stand to get hot drinks to sustain us as we queued for a ride. I had to give up after 20 minutes of nothing happening. As for the staff, I got the general impression that, like me, they would rather have been somewhere else: many were clearly doing their best, but I do not take kindly to being barked at for failing to respond immediately to instructions in rapid fire French having waited in a queue for nearly an hour in the cold. I have graded the experience based on the standards we were expecting of Disney, which, in the manner of the elevator in the scary Hotel ride, have plummeted. My advice is to spend the day in Paris instead   see the sights (the Eiffel Tower is genuinely thrilling), ride the water bus, take in a gallery or museum, have a slap up lunch in relaxed surroundings   all for a fraction of the price. Even the Paris cops, despite the body armour and artillery, were friendly, posing for photos with kids and giving directions with a smile when we needed it   maybe some of the Disney people could learn something from them!",0
29910,"My son and I had our first visit and were underwhelmed by the experience. Many of the buildings and rides are in dire need of a good painting. Also the ride ques are nonexistent. There is little to no shade while waiting in the cramped lines. Even the new Pixar Pier is out in the heat surrounded by nothing but concrete. I am glad to have seen Walt's original, but probably will not return.",0
21925,"I was so excited to go to the happiest place on Earth with my four kids just a week ago. We did prepare for our trip by using ridemax which helped a lot. We were able to ride almost everything. I would never ever recommend someone go to Disneyland without a plan set out. We saw only 2 characters during our 14 hour visit. They clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than Disney World at Christmas! The employees are not as friendly as the cast members at Disney World. In fact a few times they were just downright rude. As we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son,  Hey KID, its THIS WAY!  and thats just not what you get at Disney World. The cast members there (disney world) are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small. It was not magical and it was way over crowded. You'd think that for as much as they charge to get in, they could manage the crowds a little better. If you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip Disneyland. We were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to Peter Pan's flight and the line was already wrapped around the building. It was total Chaos there. During the parades you are shoulder to shoulder. Once you've been to Disney World, Disneyland is just one big let down. We got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left. The employee we encountered there was also rude. If you want the experience of Disney but can't make it to Disney World then by all means go just make sure you go EARLY and have a plan (I suggest ridemax). If you want a truly magical experience, skip it and fly to Orlando instead. I am glad we got to mark it off our bucket list but we will not go back.",0
9051,"For folks who have visited other Disneyland Parks, this would appear to be a mini version. However what is encouraging is that more attractions are being added and there is a roadmap to do so. The attractions are up to the mark, the 3D show as well as Lion King and Live Disney shows are excellent   appealing to kids and adults equally. Eating options within the park are adequate, though at times crowded. We visited during X Mas holidays and could see the special lighting and decorations. Souvenier shops are pricey, somewhat exhorbitant for some of the Disney branded items. The acess to Disneyland is superb, right next to MTR station, car parks and bus stations are easily walkable by kids. There was a very long queue to get the entry tickets, especially given holiday season, However we had pre booked on internet (or one could book at select MTR stations) and collected the tickets by swiping the same credit card which was used to buy the tickets online on ticket collecting machines   which was a breeze. Overal fine experience.",0
36828,we came half term week it was manic long ques for the rides a few rides were close for refurbishment we was lucky as we stayed at a Disney hotel we got two extra hours in the magic kingdom park so we got to see some of the characters before the very long ques started at 10am the food is normal priced for a theme park we was allowed to take food into the park so just got ice cream and cakes if you can get a fast pass much better than waiting with kids for over 60mins for a ride the dreams show is fab but the lights and ears that work with the show are bit over priced at 20 euro each the best time to go on some of the busy rides are when the when the parade is on at 5.30 or park opens but you will need to run and miss the stampede of people trying to get there ,0
29912,"Visited for 3 days with two boys aged 3 and 6. Stayed on resort and booked with half board which I   d recommend if you   re going to stay at one of the Disney hotels. Reasonable value, although still expensive for what you receive but sort of works out better if you want to eat in resort. both parks had enough to do and rides for both boys who aren   t the tallest 3 and 6 year olds. ",0
36826,"Came feb half term. NEVER AGAIN. Like previous reviewers have stated, be prepared to queue! To get your bags searched(I took in a carrier bag of snacks and it was fine) to get into the main entrance, to get fast passes, to buy a drink and not forgetting, to get on the rides. I can laugh now, but at the time it is completely SOUL DESTROYING. You were looking at anything between 40 to 90 minutes wait times. Not fun when you have to explain it to a bored 6 year old why you are waiting every 5 mins, with the cold seeping into your bones, this would wear anyone's patience down. We queued for phantom manor for 40 mins and then nothing! The queue just stopped moving. We were stood there like lemons not knowing what was happening, no one came to tell us anything. In the end we had wasted enough time so left like everyone else and asked the lady at the gate, she was very smiley and said it was a technical fault and it would be up and running in 2 minutes. Too late! We had already lost our place in the queue. I wanted to punch her in the face. What rides we did get on we enjoyed, esp crush's coaster, and the ratatouille ride. We managed a few fast passes, when we could get them. Food looked overpriced and mass produced. Take lots of snacks with you you'll need them in the never ending queues. We left to eat in the village, much better but a pain to walk there and back again. I thought the French attendants were nice and polite, they could teach the staff at Alton towers a thing or 2, and the park from what I could see was clean. But they have to sort out the broken seats on rides and queue times, my intention on going to disney was to be happy, not to feel as much anger as I did! Overall I won't be coming again for a long time, it was such a dissapointing and stressful visit, and I didn't feel the magic I first felt when I visited 15 years ago.",0
12309,"Was at the park the entire day, didn't see any characters. Disney World has large fans blowing in the long lines, helps a lot. Star Wars ride closed at 8, even though the park was open until midnight. Disney World cast members greet you with,  Have a magical day.  It adds to the experience. That being said, the place was clean, the cast members were nice. ",0
29871,"...too many  technical problems , far too long queues, and far too few landmark rides for older children.After our visit I wrote to Disney:Dear Sirs,Having had the misfortune to visit Disney Paris last Friday, I would like to know how you consider the experience anything other than poor.My daughter (aged 12) and I arrived just after 10.00am. We made our way to the Thunder Mountain ride. By the time we reached it , it was already a 45 minute wait. Next we made our way to the Indiana Jones ride. It was closed due to technical problems. Over to the Hyperspace Mountain, to find it closed. Back to Thunder Mountain, where it was now a 75 minute wait, so we tried our luck at Indiana Jones again. Still a technical problem, but luckily resolved soon after we arrived. On to the Pirates, where we waited an hour. Back to Hyperspace Mountain, but still down. After four hours in your park we had managed only three rides!Your fast pass was virtually useless, as the times quickly extended so far that closing time would probably have arrived sooner.We decided to try Thunder Mountain again, and after more than 60 minutes of waiting, when we were within sight of boarding, it developed a  technical problem , and we all had to be  evacuated . When I asked a member of staff what the problem was, and how soon it might be resolved, I was told that the problem was that the guests were not entering and leaving the ride quickly enough, and that this had caused a shut down. So your  technical problem  was our fault! An hour of waiting for absolutely nothing. The waiting time on this ride, when it started again, ran out to 115 minutes: and that was the optimistic figure on your sign, which all invariably underestimated the actual waiting time! The  fast pass  time was already showing 9.30pm.On our fourth visit to Hyperspace Mountain we did actually find it operating, and managed only a 45 minute wait as individual riders. No second ride though, because it soon was out of action again. We did manage a second trip on the Pirates ride, and another three on Indiana Jones, before finally giving up as 10.00pm approached. So in 12 hours, with no break for refreshments, we had achieved a grand total of EIGHT RIDES. That's roughly 90 minutes of our time for each three or four minutes of entertainment.My daughter commentated that much was made of the  girly  princesses, but little of the less stereotypical ones (Moana, Mulan and Pocahontas), and very little in similar vein for boys. She wanted to visit the Pocahontas play area to see what it was like, but it too was closed, for no obvious reason. We tried to use the railway, but it closed early.Either you need to admit fewer guests, or provide more landmark rides, and seriously reduce the amount of down time due to technical problems. At present I could not recommend Disney Paris to anyone, and feel that the experience is very poor value, not just for money, but also of our time.Regards,RESPONSE: NONE",0
36507,"The Disneyland Park in Paris compares well with its Florida counterparts in most regards. Accessibility is much easier being close to the railway station. The smaller size of the park makes it easier to get around. The newer attractions are of a very high standard and the evening firework show is incredible   much better than the one in Florida.There are some problems though, or at least there were when we visited. So many of the attractions were closed. Really some areas of the park had very little to offer. I know they have to do maintenance some time, but I can only comment on my experience and to close so much at once really hurts. This causes two problems as not only is there less to see but what is open gets deluged with visitors. More annoyingly signs would point tantalisingly to an attraction which we followed for some distance only to find that it was closed. This added insult to injury. When an attraction is closed for scheduled maintenance for several weeks the signs should come down.Some of the queues were very long, but careful planning avoided the worst of them. They were dull though: chain zig zags should be consigned to the past and queue lines should be made interesting and engaging as they are in many other theme parks. Some of the queues are painfully slow   as my son said  Look, there's something over taking us. It's a tortoise.  We did our best to pass the time....Basic maintenance was lacking in some areas. I tried 5 drinking fountains to find one that worked   this should simply not be the case. This coupled with the fact that many of the areas that sell drinks were closed meant we sometimes had to walk round half the park to get a drink   of anything.The displayed queue times can only ever be an indication, but often we found they were wildly inaccurate. We quickly learned to ignore the published times and go by our own judgement based on the length of the queue. Surely Disney can do better than this.On the last day we needed to store a bag in the lockers. We found the lockers, to be told they were no longer in use and we had to leave the park (back through the turnstiles) and walk some distance to a luggage facility that does not appear on the map and with no signs. Then re join the lengthy and slow moving queues to get back into the park. This took a frustrating 45 minutes. The maps are published regularly and should be updated to reflect this.We found in many respects basic efficiency was lacking. The staff were friendly and engaging but seemed to always take the long way round. The ridiculous entry system for people with push chairs left us shaking our heads. Watching the staff going backwards and forwards through the central door to by pass the turnstiles was like watching something from the chuckle brothers.These issues go beyond minor niggles and really should be resolved. The park is a fantastic place and these things shouldn't deter people from visiting. We took the knocks and regarded them as  first world problems  making a concious effort to stay good humoured rather than get too frustrated, but it could be done so much better.When we visited it was a beautiful warm and sunny week in April. I would imagine if the weather was bad it would take the shine off the experience a little, but would also shorten the queues.Disney is a premium product and it is fair to judge it accordingly. We enjoyed our time a lot, but it could be so much better. I find it amazing that such inefficient and frustrating practices are not tackled. State of the art attractions are expensive. Drinking fountains lockers, signs and maps are cheap. But my enduring memory is of the latter..",0
21810,I got the three day So Cal Pass for a very good price. I was excited they brought it back since it wasn't available in 2013. I see why they brought it back though. So many of the rides were closed! What a disappointment! The park gets incredibly packed now and the prices are ridiculous. I won't come back in a very long time. ,0

37024,"We are Disney fanatics. One of the big reasons for going to Paris was to see DLP! And we were, I am sad to say, disappointed. Although there are some very cool rides, and the Disneyland Park itself is very pretty, it lacks the magic of the US parks. Staff are not at all friendly (such a stereotype, but it is true), the Studios park is quite ugly and poorly themed, and crowd control is zero. There are several rides that are certainly worth going to  and really, they DO make the trip worthwhile, just be prepared for an experience where guests are viewed as some sort of irritating nuisance. NO ONE will tell you to have a magical day here. We had seasons passes  and I had to FIGHT to get them because I kept my maiden name, my husband hadn't joined us, and the staff refused to believe that my children were mine. It was a nightmare experience.GREAT RIDES AT STUDIOS: Ratatouille is well worth it! IT is a very innovative dark ride. We ate at the restaurant and it was very poor, and we waited for two hours beyond our reservation... but the d  cor is very very well done. The ride makes you feel that you actually are a tiny mouse in a French kitchen! The queue is breathtaking... you wait on the rooftops of Paris. I would return to Disneyland just for this queue.CRUSHES COASTER: the lines are terrible, even at rope drop expect to wait up to an hour. but.. the ride is astonishing! It blends a dark ride with an indoor coaster and my kids couldn't get enough. Rude ride operators questioned my daughter if she was 7 every time we rode, but other than that we loved this ride. Even the queue is cool, you wait on a pier in Sydney. It perfectly simulates the experience of riding the current with the turtles from Finding Nemo.TOWER OF TERROR: my kids hated the one in Orlando... this is an abbreviated version, and just right for my kids... it has the drop thrill but less of the ghost story.ATTRACTIONS WORTH SEEING AT DISNEYLAND PARK:Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: this is the longest version of this ride at any Disney park... and you can tell! three lift hills of awesome family fun! We rode this 50 times last summer. Pirates of the Caribbean: this blends the gorgeous queue of the Orlando park with the long ride of the California park... and it includes a few big surprises! Our favorite version of this ride.Disney Dreams: the nighttime show is great... but we waited 2 hours to see it and still didn't have the best seats. Disney needs to improve viewing for this show and perhaps introduce a fastpass for a viewing area. It was not fun to wait 2 hours... one night we showed up a mere 90 minutes early and there was no hope that we would get a spot to sit to see the show.Walk Throughs: there are some cool ones here  Jules Verne's submarine, Aladdin, an Alice in Wonderland walk through... neat stuff.It is super easy to get to from Paris  there is one train that goes directly to the entrance, it was never crowded and always air conditioned. I would never stay at this resort  the staff are far too unfriendly, and the access from the city of Paris is just too convenient (you are deposited from the train very few steps from the front gate)",0
31520,"Have been to both Anaheim and Hong Kong Disney previously. For some reason this park did not quite have the same Disney  atmosphere  as the other parks.The castle was beautiful, but was very disappointed to find that the Indiana Jones ride was not the same as in Anaheim   its just a roller coaster here (not a fan of roller coasters)Food choices were limited   shame there was no southern food as in Anaheim.Enjoyed the Haunted Mansion, Its a small world and the pirates of the caribbean ( same as original)",0
37026,"My husband and I took our 3 children ( aged 14,11 and 6) to euro disney for 4 days over new year. It was a very costly 4 days!! We stayed In the Disneyland hotel which is at the entrance gates. The park is really lovely and I completely agree with the previous review from browneyedowl. The ques were too long and very few staff on hand to offer help or assist ace. The park was very busy and we also found it impossible to sit with a coffee to warm up before trying new rides. We were lucky enough to have golden tickets from the hotel to let us skip a few ques we also entered the parks early when they were quiet. The fast passes are good but it takes a while to get to grips with it all! The parades and the lighting of the Christmas tree were fantastic. The look on the faces of my daughters were enough to make the whole experience worth while. The food is very bad and incredible expensive. This coupled with the miserable staff makes it a very sad experience! If you can then do take a picnic, there are lockers so you don't need to carry it all day.",0
21812,"We went as a couple being in america you have to visit disneyland! Well we wished we hadn't bothered as there was only 3 rides that were slightly thrilling. We found California land the better of the two. But i wouldn't recommend going as a couple if you are looking for great rides, because it is definitely aimed more at children. I would go back with children but never as a couple again. The one great thing they now offer is front of the line pass, so you can go up and scan your ticket and get a return time where you can come back to a much shorter line. Beware these can only be used once on every ride.So i would suggest going round all the rides you want to go on first scan your ticket, then go back to the first ride and back track. ",0
29833,"Ok, so if you have a day to kill and you look online and at the map to do your research you can pretty much pick 10 or so things to make it still a magical day. For that reason, we feel accomplishment for what we got done in one day. Thunder mountain, Ratatouille and Crush   s Coaster for certain for a fast pass. The Marvel Superheroes Unite Show was great. Get in line early though*at least half hour before show time, bring food or drink while you queue*.My Son had spending money and the biggest surprise in the park was the value he got for it! Lego BOGOHP and    20 for a create your own Mr Potato Head with as many accessories as you can fit on and in the box! We got an absolute TON! Paying    25 for parking after you   ve bought your ticket online seems stingy. We were in two minds whether to take the free shuttle from our hotel, however thought it beneficial to have a car to go as we please. Didn   t realise we   d pay for parking that much. Wish we just took the shuttle. They   re so frequent! Food...yep, you guessed it. So expensive. Earl Of Sandwich    33 for 4 sandwiches? All in all it was above average. It   s a small park with a high demand which makes it SO busy. Things like characters being found across the park is fun however you get selfish 20 something year old women who will crowd and not take into consideration how long your short child has been waiting to cuddle that character. These young women get giggly and shove. Should always have to queue I believe. Marvel Summer Of Superheroes was really unapparent. I know the SpiderMan one was not available for the whole school holidays in the end and unless you met Captain America or watched the Marvel Show, you   d be none the wiser that it was    Superhero Summer.   ",0
3860,"Visited the park with my family and found that it was not value for money, staff friendliness was very poor, communication in English was a challenge, not enough English maps, choice of food and beverage was poor and not all accepted credit cards and it was quite small compared to any other Disneyland Park anywhere in the world. Good attractions included Big Grizzly Runaway Mine cars, Jungle River Cruise, Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh, Mickeys PhilharMagic and Hyperspace Mountain. There was a mid afternoon parade which was poorly advertised. Lots of shops. I would not go to this attraction if you have visited the ones in Orlando and Los Angeles. Rather visit other attractions in Hong Kong.",0
21805,"I was part of a group and we all came to the realization that the expensive pricing, the fact that you are squeezed into the amusement park is not amusing. With so many other tourists constantly milling close around you. Most of us adults got sick and tired of being shoulder to shoulder with thousands of people for up to 10 hours! The food was OK. I also saw a few Disney trucks with the brand name Sodexo on them. Sodexo is a world wide institutional catering services provider company. In other words many of Sodexo's clients are hospitals and universities. I personally have better things to do on my vacation having to spend an hour waiting on a ride if I wanted to take one . . . . especially so after paying a ton of money for the park entrance fee.",0
29832,"I was absolutely appalled with how poorly this place is managed! They oversell their tickets resulting in the park being so beyond overcrowded to the point of it being a health and safety risk of suffocating! The density of the crowds was a particular nightmare for me as I am a highly sensitive person who gets really panic stricken being in crowds usually, but this was on a whole new level from the usual crowds I've had to suffer with before! They clearily oversell their tickets instead of setting a limit to the amount of people that enter the park and controlling it, as like I mention crowds are beyond abysmal and you wait in queues for rides for 1 hour and a half, so long that by the time you're done there you've only gotten round 2 or 3 rides. Not only that but literally whenever we went to one of the restaurants there to eat there were endless queues which were moving verly slowly, which was also the same for whenever you wanted to get a drink from a cart truck or something, which is so impractical and wrong when it's something essential like food and drink that you need. I mean yes it was peak season being the end of August but I still think there should of been some control over the crowds queues to make things more accessible, like not overselling their tickets.Something that really infuriated and disgusted me was when we were in the studio park and there was a sudden rainstorm, we were queuing outside the theatre place to see a show there where there was such a dense crowd to say the least, mostly due to the fact it was raining and people were trying to shelter, that there was an actual risk of suffocating as there was not control or structure of this crowd. I was infuriated and disgusted by the fact that there were no staff controlling this crowd, to say for instance that there were too many people and this crowd was all too unstructured and out of control and getting rid of lots of the people nearer the back, but instead they made the crowd worse by asking people who were just sitting down out of the queue to shelter from the rain to get up and join the queue, not the back of it but beside the people who were already at the front, despite the fact they were outside the barrier and people outside the barrier are not allowed to join the queue, so they were basically breaking their own rules! It was disgusting, they didn't do anything to control the extremely dense crowd, instead making it worse, and just stood there apathetically, letting the crowd go denser and denser making people wait for ages. We left the crowd eventually ofcourse.Just overall appalling.",0
37032,"We are regular visitors to Disneyland Paris at Christmas and invest a lot in the experience. The parks can look fantastic, really festive. But the magic spell has broken. So have many of the rides   the big attractions   are constantly being closed for  technical reasons . And the parks can no longer take the number of people who seem to still want to go there. And I'm not talking about people like us, who travel from abroad who stay in the 4 star hotels, eat in the top restaurants... no, the parks are now full to breaking point because of the Annual Passport that local people are able to buy. These passports cost less than    200. Use it just 5 times and every visit you make to the park from then on, is free. So we high paying visitors are forced to queue   for rides, restaurants, toilets, even entrance to the park   with local people who are paying nothing. They may just show up on a sunny day and queue for two hours for one ride, and then go home. Because they don't have to stay all day to get their money's worth as it's all free for them. On this our 17th successive year here at Christmas, five of the main attractions broke   including Thunder Mountain   and some visitors weren't told about the breakdowns until they had been queueing for almost an hour. And nobody was ever told when the breakdown might be fixed. Last year, 2013, Thunder Mountain broke while we were on the ride and we had to be escorted out through underground emergency tunnels. And it's not just the parks and rides that are broken. We stay in the 4 star New York Hotel   and on our first morning we were told we couldn't eat breakfast in our usual restaurant and had to be shoved into a noisy diner with no windows, because a business convention was using our regular restaurant privately. It took strong complaint to get that reversed the next day. Then for two nights we tried to book the New York Hotel's Manhattan restaurant for dinner. First night we were told we had to eat at 7.30pm because they were fully booked after that. When we got there it was only half full and never filled up. The second night we were told there was only a table for two left. So we took that and four of our party had room service. When the two of us got to the restaurant, we again found it half empty. When we complained we were told we could invite the rest of our family after all   but it was too late. Room service had already been ordered.In our room in the New York, the two sinks blocked on two occasions, and the toilet blocked on one occasion. Back to the parks, and queues for the restaurants were spilling out into the streets. On our last day our bag full of valuables was stolen from us. I don't think families on holiday for a magical experience would do that kind of thing. That kind of criminal behaviour is for people who are in and out of there fast.The magic has gone from Disneyland Paris. The Disney people, who are so protective of their brand in every other way, should do something about it.",0
29831,"Rude staff, overpriced and too busy. Go to Florida or some other park.  Queuing for everything and not one staff member apologised.",0
37034,We visited the park 29th dec to 3rd jan 2015.....first visit to eurodisney had two children with us 6 and 8 years old. We have had a great week and the kids loved it but we did have a few complaints!!! The queues are relentless... For everything. Even a cup of tea takes around 20minutes. Our children weren't big enough for space mountain and Indiana Jones rides. We managed to get on thunder mountain as we had breakfast one morning in park with early pass otherwise we would have had to queue for over an hour. The smaller rides did have better waiting times. We went hoping New Years eve would have a big firework display and we found this a little disappointing. We waited by the Disney lake and saw fireworks to 'let it go' which by the end of the holiday I was fed up go hearing. Most things seemed to be focused around frozen!!!! Not every girl loves the film....... We watched the frozen parade which again was poor...... Just the two characters in a carriage waving!!!!!! shouldn't have to queue for such a long time to see the Disney characters ..... That's the whole point isn't it?On our last day in the park (New Years day) a lot of the rides did seem to be broken and not working which when you pay so much to visit is a disappointment. We choose to go into Paris one day to give us a break and had a fab day ..... Glad I have been and kids loved it but no need to visit again......,0
21807,this was way too expensive and crowded each line was about 3 hours. I don not recommend this whatsoever...,0
15905,"Fancy a visit to a theme park where you have to queue almost an hour for every ride? How about walking while saying  excuse me  every 2 min? That was our experience at Disneyland on a weekday in Spring which was not a school holiday. How crowded can it get during its peak season then?? The park is not big, if you take a walk around to just have a look it'll just take you an hour to see everything in the crowd. We only got to go on 4 rides as each time there was a queue of 45min. The other popular rides such as Its A Small World? Forget it! 75min! A photo with Mickey? 60min wait. It's just impossible to queue that long without small children getting impatient. We didn't enjoy our visit due to the crowd but I think for little children it was still magical to see Mickey or a princess walking around. ",0
37022,"Just back from Euro Disney Paris had two days at the parks, over crowded pushing all the time no manners at all, my 10 year old was pushed thumped and that was only walking to rides that was between 100 mins to 120 mins wait to get on,we waited for 40 mins in the freezing cold to go on buzz light year to be told that there was technical problems the ride is closed, but this seemed to be happening a lot, the fast pass wasn't any better same thing between 40 to 45 min wait and as for the disney characters well the parade came from the castle and went in the opposit direction from where we were standing waiting for 20 mins again all freezing, ye maybe wrong time of the year to go, but didn't expect to wait for up to 2 hrs to get on the ride that are ment to be for family's . if your up for queuing well this is your holiday, you have to que for everything from coffee 30 mins to the toilets 30mins the parks are too small for the amount of people going through there gates and the rides can't cope",0
15899,"Quite frankly it's hard to say it's the happiest place on earth when the average wait time for a 60 second ride is 45 minutes. And we didn't even try to go on rides that were popular, those wait times were rediculous. One of the very few positives about Disneyland are the characters and getting pictures with your child with those characters. Each day there are times and locations of where those pictures can be obtained. However, the character are rarely there and they are never there at the times that they say they will be. If you see a character and want a picture, sprint to try and get in line. Odds are that if you see the character when they first come out, you will get a picture. If however, you see the character already in he process of taking pictures, the line has already been cut off and you won't get a picture. Simply put, the character pictures are a huge part of the appeal for my son, he loves the Disney characters, but we can't get him a picture because of the reasons listed above. There are too few characters on a whole and their limited availability makes the issue much worse. I do understand the issue of someone having to dress up in a costume and that it's not pleasant, I support them not being in those costumes for extended periods of time. I'm just saying, get some more people to play those roles so that people can actually get pictures with them.Disneyland park is severely outdated and has ridiculous wait times. California adventure is more wide open but is limited in their offerings to young children. For a 2 1 2 year old, you can do the whole park in less than 2 hours, there just isn't a lot available to them. My son loved the Disney Jr. Show, I highly recommend it for parents of children that like doc mcstuffins, Sofia the first and the Mickie mouse club house shows. Put simply, the is insufficient value at these parks to warrant the enormous expense that people are asked to pay. I would not recommend anyone go to either severely overcrowded park.",0
6705,"We are a family of 5 and we went to disneyland this year and it was alright, it was mostly for children. The best thing was the mountain rollercoaster and the 9pm fireworks. The weather was hot and there was too much people. The prices of the food were like 98 hongkong dollars, which was quite expensive, it was nasty and dry. I would not reccomend eating the food.",0
37019,"Going for new year it wasn't quite as cold in the day as expected and the rain held off.Due to annual passes Disneyland was very, very busy and at times crowding became dangerous when leaving the park.Staff were on the whole friendly, unlike many of the rude patriots. I didn't enjoy the smoke anywhere but restaurants and ride queues as my kids were continuingly enhaling secondhand smoke. The park was clean however and food as expected, but no soft drinks other than water for kids  we took our own.We didn't manage to get on all the rides attractions due to queues (meet princesses 4hours) and bug thunder mounting having two days of technical difficulties.Those we did go on were enjoyable and the parade was fantastic, as was the light show.Not sure if I will return to Paris again, but viewed this trip as a  warm up  for Florida. ",0
37018,"My girlfriend and I visited Disney Land Paris on the 2nd January to celebrate the new year, and to be honest, we were left extremely disappointed and we left to go home a lot earlier than we intended to. So where do I begin      .We arrived at Opera at 8.25am on the morning for the bus to depart at 8.40am. The bus was nowhere to be seen and there were 2 other couples who we did not know also waiting for the bus that did not arrive. So the Shuttle bus was either extremely early and left without us even though we were on time, or did not turn up at all. We then all had to pay more money to get the train to Disney Land (which is a much better idea anyway). When we eventually arrived at the park we were looking for somewhere to eat in the morning but no restaurants were open and the only place that was open for breakfast was for hotel guests only. We then walked around the park and proceeded to try and get food from various vendors   stalls in the park but they were all closed, empty, or out of service. We did find 1 coffee stand in in Discovery Land but the Milk was off and sour so I had to throw it away which was another waste of money. So we did not get food until 11.45am in one of the fast food places at the back of the park opening for lunch time. Starving! A number of rides were also out of order for a while (thunder mountain, Indiana jones, toy story and others) which meant there was not a lot else to choose from for adults in the main park, and since the other rides were out of order for an unknown time it was impossible to get on the other decent rides because the queues were so big! So we did not go on a lot of rides during our time there. We were actually queuing for Toy Story for 20 minutes then an announcement came on saying that it was out of service due to a technical fault, we waited another 10 minutes before we decided to leave because no progress was made, but when we left the queue the lady at the gate then said you can go back the ride is back on but by that time we already lost our place in the queue and it was still another 45 minutes wait. No announcement was made that the ride was back on for the people waiting and we were very annoyed that we wasted so much time. So we moved on. On two separate occasions we queued up to get our picture taken with the Disney Characters in the park, the lines were not that big so we were optimistic. But both times a member of staff told us that no more pictures were allowed to be taken so we didn   t even get a chance to get our picture taken. This would not normally be a huge issue, but on top of everything else it was starting to take the mickey (no pun intended). Due to the number of issues, lack of good service, lack of rides available and general poor quality of rides we left the park at 5pm feel very unsatisfied. We were hoping to use our Express ticket to get the bus home at 8pm (since the 1st one never showed on the time stated) but we could not last another 3 hours in the park after being left frustrated. We had a magnificent time in Paris in general, but I am sad to say Disney was certainly the only low point. I am astonished this cost me   162.00 in total and I hope in future if we decide to visit again that the experience is a lot more enjoyable.",0
33052,"Went with a group of friends in October. The atmosphere was lovely. Halloween decorations were brilliant too!Only issue was the rides, after waiting for an hour we were told there was a fault   this happened to us 3 times    Also i was there 17 years ago as a child, most of the rides are the same, and the videos accompanying them too   some with deceased actors doing the documentary. People were very nice and friendly ! x",0
21818,"The park just simply can not handle that many people. Not to be rude but why do so very many people feel yhe need to bring babies to the park?!?! Everything scares the heck out of them, people just stop in the mitdde of foot traffic to tend to the baby, they leave them all over the place and 1 2 the parents are too busy texting to discipline the 5 yr old that is pushing the baby in the stroller all over in front of people. Leave your texting life at home and enjoy the park...maybe baby can stay with grandma for the day? Disney...rethink max occupancy!! ",0
31519,"For some reason the Park only opens from 8 10am for those lucky enough to stay in a Disney hotel for the rest of us it opens at 10am when the queues for rides were already 60mins long. There were far too many people in the park for the available rides and waiting time were an average 60 80 mins, even the Fast pass machines closed within minutes of opening. The rides were plagued with breakdowns and we were waiting for rides then got turned away because they closed then had to start queuing all over again making it nearly 2  3 hour wait. The whole 3 days were like this although to be fare 1 day was mostly due to thunderstorms. There is an extreme lack of seating so you have to sit on pavements to get a rest. The illuminations were fantastic and in my opinion the only part worth seeing the reason for the average review rather than poor, but they are not on until 11pm so you have to sit on the concrete for at least 2 hours to get a decent view. There is just no seating and at the rides they could do with the flip down seats as 2 hours is a long wait standing up. To be honest I wouldn't go back. It mostly about retail and the restaurants are so expensive, take a packed lunch dinner or you'll spend a fortune. The Disney characters come out several times a day and you will have to queue for about an hour as well.",0
3871,Went with my mum and aunties and overall experience was good. Really enjoyed the 4D Disney movie and the show performances there so much with dancing and singing. Make sure you check on the timetable of each of the show so that you wouldn't miss it. ,0
37013,"We came here for our honeymoon and it wasnt all that great. The expense of the tickets is to be expected as the whole disney land theme. As soon as we entered there was a show which was to mary poppins which was the best part of the entire day, it seeme to be ever hour or so which was good for bits that you may have missed due to the crowds. The food situation is sketchy half of it was closed down and what was open was heaving with people, TAKE A PACKED LUNCH! Due to the closed food halls there is somewhere to sit. There was not long to wait for the rides but we didn't go on many of them. The sad part of the day was someone tried to pick our pockets as the camera bag had been sliced open thankfully they left empy handed, there are signs about that warn you of pick pockets but i suggest all value items keep home!",0
21820,"It was fun but $94 bucks for tickets. The guy I bought tickets from mocked my Texas Draw which did not set well with me. It's still The Happiest Place on earth but man oh man were the people packed in. Long waits and lots of rude, clueless people but it's still Disney ",0
3873,"My friends and I (nine of us in total) decided to visit Disneyland during our Easter break. We booked tickets beforehand, from a website that sold it cheaper, plus the meal voucher that included one meal from any restaurant in the theme park. Originally, we had been informed by a misleading website that the $100 meal voucher included both lunch and dinner, plus a snack from the vending carts (which was an extremely good deal, which was why we got the voucher in the first place). But when we got there, we were told that the $100 voucher only included one meal of your choice which was very disappointing and overly priced. I ate a bowl of Japanese styled noodles and had a drink, which were both fortunately quite delicious.As teens, we did not spend time taking photos with Mickey or any of the Disney characters. Instead, we immediately jumped into playing some of the games, including Space Mountain (my personal favorite, although it made me a little dizzy); a game called Grizzly something, I forgot (it was a very creative roller coaster, it even went backwards!); a target hitting game (we sat in moving carts and aimed at targets with a plastic gun); and a ghost house (we sat in moving carts and was guided through a haunted house with scary objects popping out at us). We loved Space Mountain and the Grizzly game, which we played more than five times each. There were many many other games that are more suitable for younger children, but since we only enjoyed more exciting   stimulating games, we didnt bother with the other games that were intended for younger children.As we had got to Disneyland quite early (right after it opened), there wasn't that much people at first and we were able to get to most of the games we wanted to play without having to line up. However, after lunch time, the lines grew increasingly longer and we started having to wait more than half a hour for each game. We left after one last ride of Space Mountain, at around 7 or 8. We had heard that the fireworks were worth watching, but since one of my friends was expected to return home at a certain time, we didnt stay to watch the fireworks.Luckily the weather was quite nice the entire day and we enjoyed all of the games we played. If you enjoy more exciting rides (roller coasters etc.), I would suggest you go to Ocean Park instead of Disneyland. Ocean park has much more rides that are more fun to go on (if you're older than 12 and not afraid of heights). From what I experienced, I would say that Disneyland is intended for younger children. anyone from under 11 years old would experience the most fun here.Have fun :)",0
37010,"firstly we did not have the printout from the internet but had a reference code which the people on the ticket gate refused to use. they advised us to email the ticket to them from the phone, after several attempts they said they did not get the email and could not help. We went to the Disney hotel who printed it out from an email no problem. I cannot understand why they could not use the reference code to get our tickets in the first place. This delayed us getting into the park by more than an hour. Not very helpful or a good start. The park itself is ok but everything is ridiculously overpriced. If they lowered prices they might find they actually sell more stuff. It's no wonder this park is losing money. The Disney magic is sadly missing. My advice is to save your money and visit Florida Disney world instead.",0
21821,Just got back after 2 days. As we were waiting in line (which seemed to never move) I often wondered if they got rid of the fast tracks that perhaps the lines wouldnt seem so bad? I noticed the rides that did not take fast track constantly moved. I personally think they should get rid of that especially when your paying close to 100.00 a park and traveling for a forever to get there.Maybe that way we could enjoy more rides instead of only a few at a time. Sad that big corporations as Disney just suck the $$$ right out of us average folk..,0
31518,Came specifically for the Jedi training academy for the kids who had been hugely excited all week about it to be told it's fully booked for the day by 11am. Got here at 10am but an hour to get through security etc.  Really disappointed,0
37007,"We went to Disney Paris for an Xmas break with our family this year and although the rides etc are quite good and similar to the ones in the US parks, you cant help but feel it isnt as good as the  Real Thing . The parades especially on xmas day where very short and poor, the lighting at night practically non existent, and worst of all the food choices where very limited and expensive. I've been 4 times to Orlando and Once to Anaheim and Paris in my opinion does not capture the Disney Magic but rather is a diluted version of it.Also the bus service to the hotels was appalling and very badly organized. The kids had a good time, but I wasnt too impressed.",0
9098,"I read some reviews on TA then i checked to the website, i didn't expect too much about this place. But overall, this place is so Disney. I came at the right time when the parade started until the fireworks time. That's the best time to come. Unfortunately, it was a holiday so the queues were everywhere and it took time. If you want to get a best view for taking pics of fireworks, please come 20 15 mins before it starts. Overall, the fireworks were WOW!! Amazing. I love it.",0
37037,"We have been to Disneyland Paris three times. The first time in 2009 and then again in 2010 for 4 days and more recently in 2014 for 5 days. The first two visits were magical and we really looked forward to returning this third time. Our third and what will be our final visit was extremely disappointing. Disneyland Paris has changed, standards have dropped and the magic and sparkle have gone. The place is run down, dated and not well kept or clean. The toilets were attrocious and filthy! The staff in the restaurants are mostly unhelpful and miserable, not what you would expect from Disney. No longer are there any seating areas for the parades, it is all kerbside, with crowds of pushing people, and the regular parades that used to occcur every hour or so have been taken out. There is now just one parade a day. The crowds are a nightmare, they just keep letting more and more people in, park, packing people in like sardines and what seems to be beyond actual capacity, therefore, those of us who pay thousands of pounds to stay there have to battle to get onto the rides with locals who pay a fraction of the price. The newest and one of the best rides Ratatouille had ridiculous queues (about 1 hr 30 mins) and broke down on the first day we tried to get on it. On one ocassion about three rides we tried to go on had broken down and overall I felt for what we were getting Disneyland Paris is overpriced and in desperate need of an overhaul. They also have this new voucher system where one meal a day and afternoon tea are included in the price of your stay. This results in everyone eating in the restaurants causing again, long queues and difficulty getting tables, e.g previously you could book Mickey's Cafe on the same day, now you have to book about 2 days ahead and have to accept a late booking. Auberg de Cendrillon, although expensive, was at least a treat in the past, now due to the voucher system, it is practically impossible to book. Again we had to accept the last lunch booking, which was very late. The characters were aloof and one character just walked off and wouldn't come over to sign my little girl's autograph book! At almost Eur 160 for lunch for three people, I would have expected a little more of a welcome, friendlier characters and better food. The atmosphere there this time around was flat and quite frankly I just wanted to pay the bill and leave. I didn't enjoy anything about this trip to Disneyland Paris and wish I had kept the memories of my last two trips and not gone this last time. I have never been to the US parks, however, I wouldn't recommend the Paris one anymore it is hugely expensive but not better than any other good theme park that you would get anywhere else in Europe, which would probably cost less, have better rides, friendlier and more helpful staff and cleaner parks!",0
37039,"This was our 15th trip to Disneyland and we are avid Disney fans, but this trip left us very very disappointed. We queued 75 minutes to ride Indiana Jones and we sat in the seat and it broke down, we queued the next day for 65 minutes and it broke down again. Space mountain and Big Thunder Mountain were also broken down. Queues were ridiculous with hardly any staff around to give information or to 'police' what was happening. The quick service restaurants were anything but quick service! This trip was a very very expensive disappointment..",0
36932,"I've visited Eurodisney several times with various young members of the family, but I doubt I shall be making any more visits. The entry prices are now outrageous, the service poor, the staff are borderline rude and really don't seem to care and many of the rides simply weren't functioning. Which means that the queues for the functioning rides are enormous and the whole process is a tiresome foot dragging obligation rather than a cheerful, happy day out with the kids. The cost of the merchandising is beyond reason and the restaurants are expensive, poor quality and dirty. No   I think I'll go elsewhere next time.",0
37067,"The Park looked lovely, the staff were friendly. But really I spent the day in a series of long queues, for food, for rides, for the bathroom, in shops. It was so crowded it was difficult to walk places. Some rides had queues of over 2 hours. And yes I know I could have bought a fast pass but why should I have to pay twice to go on the rides? Also, in the queues, a lot of the time we were next to French people smoking, despite the no smoking signs. I feel like Disneyland is really more like any other theme park as opposed to being similar to Disneyworld in Florida. We tried to make the best of the day but I really wouldn't go again. I can stand outside doing nothing for free at home.",0
15913,"We are a Disney family and love all Disney especially Orlando Disney and Epcot. Been there many times. I was disappointed with Disneyland, Anaheim. The waits which the app said were 20 minutes were often more 40 minutes and my 4 year old grandson lost interest. He was not the only child crying that day. We arrived by 9 and were out by 1:30 PM. The food stands were not good, but I did not expect so. Prices were steep. Suggest you bring in picnic lunch. The staff st the park were lovely, polite and helpful but looked overwhelmed with the crowd that day. I will come back but on a day less harried and busy. We went on Its a Small World, Pinocchio, Carousel, all excellent. Casey Circus Train Ride was a short ride for a very long wait and one could not help but see the VIP off to the left of the line getting in ahead of those of us waiting, with crying children. The train takes a small amount of visitors. ",0
21794,"Im sorry, but I just don't understand the hype. Unfortunately, we went here with a 5 year old and 10 month old in the middle of peak season. In 5 hours we managed pretty much all that Tommorow Land had to offer ( but 3 of its atractions were closed) and one attraction in Frontier Land before we had had enough. The crowds, the 2 hour wait for a 90 second ride and the unrelenting heat ruined our magical day and to top it off, the fluke encounter with Mickey Mouse never turned up on our photo pass!!! I know that it is a must, but our 5 year old preferred Disney California Adventure Park (DCAP).On the plus side, the fast passes were much more available at Disneyland than DCAP and Star tours is a good ride.",0
37063,"A four night, five day Christmas treat. Apart from the cold (December, what do you expect, so no complaints there) we generally enjoyed the parks. The rides are good on the whole, Space Mountain and Thunder mountain both better than Florida, and the hotel (New York) again pretty good, but not my idea of a 4* hotel (other then the price!!).If you stay in a Disney hotel, don't get fooled by the 'Extra Disney Hours', i.e. from 08.00 to 09.30 or 10.00 depending on the park   great, you get in two hours early and most of the rides don't open until 09.30 or 10.00. Space Mountain was open, but not working as 'it had to warm up', well who would have expected it to be cold in December eh!As for 'Crushes Coaster', one of our favourite rides but an 85 minute queue at 08.30 in the morning, at least our breakfast had plenty of time to go down.The two things that put me off gong again (this was our second time), one was the smoking, just about every other person is smoking   in a children's theme park, can you not give up the cigs for a few hours, after a few days I feel I have smoked about 100 cigs worth of other peoples smoke. I realise that people have the right to smoke outdoors, but in queues where you can't move away, with kids everywhere   be fair!!The other is the extortionate cost of food in the parks and hotel, around 40 45 Euros each per meal, for a family of 3 or 4 over a few days that really bites. If you can bear to walk to the Val d'Europe shopping centre or can taxi or drive, lots of decent restaurants where we ate for around 50 60 Euros for a family of three, much better value and gets you out of the park hotel captivity for a while.New York hotel was OK, the lobby, restaurants bars are fine, the bedrooms leave a bit to be desired. The bedrooms could do with an update, although clean and spacious, they are tired, peeling wallpaper, ancient TV (a whole 2 3 channels in English (2 news and the Disney Channel), as i said, for a 4* you should expect more.Overall we enjoyed the stay but wont be going again, we will save and go back to Florida where you can hire a good villa for 2 3 weeks for the same cost as 5 nights in the New York and there is just so much more to do and enjoy.Rod F (December 14)",0
12284,"Having being brought up with Disney, I was little disappointed when we got there. Maybe because it was raining, but that meant there were small lines....on reflection I think it was because it hasn't change much from when it first opened. Also I feel my kids 12 & 9 thought they were too old for many of the rides  attractions. Saying that the log ride and Pirates of the Caribbean were great. Also as it was raining the ponchos on offer were expensive and didn't last the day.",0
24162,Some of the rides are just old and need to be redone. There were several rides that were closed for renovations or actually broke while riding them. This park needs a facelift!,0
13135,"Sadly we went this past Monday which was during spring break for kids. That's not Disney's fault but aren't from Ca and we didn't know. I can tell you it's too crowded during spring break. You will spend your whole dayd waiting to ride. We were able to get 1 fast pass but they ran out. We rode 5 rides during our 10 hour day...ugh . Disneyland though is so dirty. There was trash floating in the castle moat, on the streets, on the rides. The bathrooms were dirty and i mean very dirty. We ate at the Blue Bayou and it was delicious. High priced but good. Although Disneyland doesn't allow alcohol California adventure does so the drunks and i mean very drunk drunks will wonder over. Im sorry Walt we love you but not your original park. We will not be back.",0
3835,"My Daughter had been wanting to go to Disneyland for quite some time so this year we decided to celebrate her birthday at Disneyland. We went in the month of June and it was Super hot. We were literally burning. It's all in the open, there are no shaded areas. Thus we were so tired in just 2 3 hours. Could not really enjoy anything. Except for the princess show which was in the auditorium, I didn't really like anything over there. It's not worth the price we have to pay. My kids also didn't really enjoy much. ",0
21804,"We had fun! Although, food are very expensive the place are amazing. it was awesome to be back again. My teenage kids are enjoying it. It's worthy.",0
37069,"After paying for 3 days at the park and 3 nights In an associated nearby hotel, we left after 1 day. Awful awful.75minute queues for 2 minute rides. Rides were old and rough. Fast pass option hardly worth the effort as you can only have 1 active at a time. We did 3 rides by 3.30pm. Awful. So so disappointing. We skipped the hotel and headed back to paris for an extra few nights . I felt sad for all the families who had saved hard to be there and promised their kids a good time. I did not see anyone smiling all day. ",0
3834,Usual Disneyland affair but disappointing as it is a lot smaller than other Disney affairs e.g. Florida. This makes the experience much less real as you can see the mountains etc   so you know you are not in DL but actually in a theme park in Hong Kong.At least the tube station was fun with Mickey Mouse themes throughout.I wouldn't recommend it but if you are a Disney fan then it might be worth a visit just to say  I've been ,0
37071,"Firstly, I have been to the magical Disney parks in America, and I was warned not to compare!! But I was very very underwhelmed with Disneyland Paris. It is the staff who inject the  magic  into the Disney experience, without their enthusiasm the magic fades   a bit like Tinkerbell with no pixie dust. The staff in the American parks pull you along on this wave of upbeat happiness which you can't help being affected by   in a good way!! They are so energetic and positive. Then we come to Paris and it is like they have hired security people, not entertainment staff! They were so paranoid about rules and regulations   don't stand there, you can't take a picture there, you're child can't put their foot there, it is closed   why   it just is go elsewhere etc... They got me thinking that there must have been a serious accident in the park for them to be so solid and serious, they had me on edge and I was with two young children. Lots of the attractions were closed, which was fine as it was winter but I felt there were too many people in the park for the amount of things to do, as the queues were ridiculous in the freezing cold and no light entertainment en route! As if!!! The Frozen parade consisted of Elsa and Anna in a horse drawn carriage miming badly to frozen songs   my little one was very disappointed, she thought she would see Olaf! Luckily we had booked Auberge de Cendrillon   the Cinderella restaurant which my two little ones enjoyed and they did chat to and meet the princesses who were lovely. So this was good but very expensive. I will not return to Disneyland Paris as I did not enjoy the  experience  and in my opinion that was down to the unfriendly, unhelpful staff. We work hard to earn the money to visit these places so it helps if our visit is appreciated by staff. Without visitors Disneyland Paris would be a very big empty site. ",0
3833,It was pouring and they only had 10 indoor rides open! Still have to pay full entry and if the weather got worse they coukd close the park and no refunds or passes given! We opted not to risk the $500 entry fee for just the few low thrill rides on offer.,0
3832,Nothing special if u had earlier visited another Disney. But for children good place to enjoy. Lot to walk. Pick discount coupons near inside entrance to avail discount on soft drinks etc. lol for them n ask for coupons . Jungle ride good. Tarzan good for kids. Don't leave ur belongings. Careful. Carry water enough   2 bottles per head. ,0
7857,"The park itself is very well kept and a great place for the kids, but as a parent having to wait 50 minutes in line for nearly all rides and then getting a ride under a minute is completely unacceptable. The kids were so disappointed. Disney is far too greedy with this and I would probably not visit again because of this. What a shame.",0
6710,"We went to HK Disneyland on the weekend when we would expect really high crowds, but the crowd level was manageable. We arrived there at 1 PM after having lunch in Tsim Sha Sui.At 3 PM, a typhoon warning was issued, it's potentially a storm coming right towards Hong Kong Disneyland, most of outdoor attractions are suddenly closed. We managed to stay there because the weather situation was bright and good enough. 1 hour after, they reopened all rides again and visitors could continue having fun! Woohoo!Some good things we experienced:1. 3 times riding Big Grizzly Mountain due to very short queue line (only 5 mins standing in line to enjoy every ride)2. Incredible fireworks to end our dayLastly, this would be an objective review. If you are a true Disney fan and have been to other Disney parks, please be open minded and realize that you are going to HK Disneyland to have fun and experience the magic of Disney in new place country. This theme park might not be as good big interesting as others, so you gotta visit other Disneyland to experience ultimate treasures and rides!HK Trip period: 18 Sept   22 Sept 2014",0
37059,"Visited here with two adults and two children (7 and 4). After paying    15 for parking we were greeted with a huge queue. We managed to get in after twenty minutes if waiting and were greeted by a second, larger queue. Thirty minutes later we arrived inside. Another    15 and we hired a buggy. The park was so packed you could barely walk or move. I spent all day in a queue for something. Queue for the toilet, queue for a drink, queue for food and finally rides. Well what a disappointment! There aren't enough in the park to keep kids happy and going all day. They need more smaller rides and bigger ones. Two roller coaster for his sized park is not enough.Some rides you had to wait for over 2 hours. The fast track system doesn't work. You can get one and then another after you use it, But some fast track tickets were for 8.30 at night when it was 11am! Ridiculous. I spent the day smelling people's cigarette smoke. , as did my children. Why can't they have areas for smokers? In three days we seen two Disney characters walking around and you couldn't approach them or have all photo. I did however see the frozen characters and Parade over and over and over and over. Don't they realise not every child likes frozen? They need more characters waking around for photo ops, not one station with yet another queue to wait for a picture. Staff are either very friendly or majorly miserable! Now for the food. Two slices if pizza, two muffins, two drinks and two packets if crisps,    36!!!!! This park is seriously money hungry. Prices are ridiculous. We spent the whole day disappointed, and frustrated. I would never ever return to this place not would I recommend anyone visit. All that hard work saving for a magical trip and we couldn't have been more disappointed! On another disappointing note; we paid   500 for four people for four days. Only to chat to some fellow frustrated park goers and discovered a year ticket for an adult is   139 and a child   39. So we could of paid less and come for 365 days!!!! I am so extremely disappointed with Disney, the whole experience was dire!",0
15911,"It cost us nearly $500 NZ to go to Disneyland for one day. The park was insanely crowded. We managed three rides, as the queues were hours longs. Aside from the rides, the rest of the park is over priced souvenirs and food. Totally not worth $500 or wasting a day on. Several 'attractions' were closed, but you were allowed to walk on them   seriously what is the point of walking on a stationary riverboat or steam train.",0
3844,"It's Disneyland right so it should be fun! Well it's not that they don't know what their doing its just not quite happening here but things will change soon. For the high price of admission, the park isn't up to standards meaning it's small compared to the others. Combined with overcrowding, long lines for the kids rides and lack of shade in the sweltering heat here equals no fun and probably the main reason they are losing money. Charging the same entrance fee as other Disneylands double the size with twice as much to do also makes no sense. Looks like lots of construction is going on so hopefully in a few years I'll be back to see what has improved.",0
37055,"We visited Hong Kong Disneyland a few years back (2011) with our now 8 and 6 year old and we were all totally enthralled with the Disney experience.You can imagine our disappointment when Paris Disneyland came nowhere close to those expectations, Overcrowded   to be expected on New Years Day I suppose   but the queue times are a total joke. We queued for a Thunder Mountain for nearly 2.5 hours despite the sign saying 70 minutes. The place was freezing with not a single heater anywhere. The food prices make the cinemas look like a charity   12 euro for two messily boxes of popcorn.The place does look amazing and the rides (if you can get on them) are fabulous but the votes are in and we won't be going back. Disney have definitely lost our family as customers, probably for good. I'd have a hard time convincing the kids to go through that again.",0
3845,"if you're heavily into shopping for Disney merchandise, then this is the place for you, otherwise it really isn't a big deal. always imagined Disney land to be really magical, but apart from a couple of rides, it wasn't at all special. lots of long queues in the horrible heat and humidity to do anything, including say hello to the characters. they don't walk around the crowds, they just stand somewhere while people queue up to have photos with them. the fireworks were really so low that they could only be seen from one place in the whole park which felt like they encouraged over crowding. even the parades generate stampeding crowds. wouldn't go there again, definitely not worth the money",0
37052,"We went to the park on New Year's Eve. We expected it to be busy but nothing could have prepared us for the crowds and lack of organisation at the park. Unlike at Disney Land in California the characters are not walking around the park and mingling with visitors. There was a 150 minute wait to meet the princesses and an hour wait to meet Mickey. In the 14 hours that we were in the park we managed to get on just 8 rides. We queued for two rides, only to get to the front of the queue for them to then break down. Other rides had broken down too. The 'parades' were anything but. One consisted of the two princesses from Frozen riding in a carriage. Nothing more. The other was the princesses and some soldiers which passed by in a minute. The Secret Wishes show at the castle however was amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We took food in with us and snacked during the day. The prices are astronomical. Coke is 3.19 euro, Pack of crisps 1.99 euro. Restaurants were serving New Year's Eve menus at 229 euro per head. We had to slump for McDonald's in the Disney Village. But I guess you don't really go to Disney for the food. We spent New Year in the Disney Studios. Our ticket included access to both parks but there is no way we could have done both in a day. The entertainment up to New Year was great and the fireworks were superb.I wouldn't rush back to Disney, Had a far better experience in California. Avoid at New Year and my advice would be to travel during term time.",0
37051,"Me, my Partner and another couple went to Disneyland Paris for New Years on a coach trip for the day. Myself and my friend have previously worked at Disney World in Orlando and as my Partner had a broken leg, we were confident she would be well looked after as that is the Disney way.After just over an hour in the park and with it still fairly quiet we went to the Hollywood Studios Wheel chair and stroller rental area to find they had run out of both! in Disneyland!? We went to the information desk and were treated disgustingly by the 'Manager' Oliver. They refused to take my number and ring me when a wheelcahir was available, ringing an external company was out of the question and to top it off we were suggested my 25 year old partner should pay for a stroller?! Oliver said 'if it is such a big deal why didn't you bring your own wheelchair?' that is not provided when you have a temporary brake and it is expected to provide wheelchairs where ever you go these days. Eventually we were offered an easy access pass for her and 1 guest that would mean our party splitting up. The most upsetting part was the staff watched us for an hour trying to get in touch with the hospital to try and get a fax or email confirmation of the injury and they knew we were only there for a day before issuing this pass. As ex cast members in America that would have been just out of the question at Disney. They strive to make create happiness and magic and we were nearly in tears after this situation. In the end we had to split up from our friends for every single ride and spend ages trying to meet up again, time it right and spend i don't know how much calling each other to meet up. The lack of wheel chairs and push chairs was evident throughout the park as it got later you could see parents straining to carry their tired children and saw grown adults being pushed around in push chairs. In general, the floor was cracked and dirty and the cast members were extremely disappointing. It was hard to find any staff when walking around, some didn't know where bathrooms were or when shows were on. I saw a cast member using their mobile, smoking and  in most cases more concern with talking to their colleagues than the guests. i understand their may be a language barrier for some but after spending 14 hours in the park overall i only had 1 cast member wish me a Happy New Year. For those who have visited or worked in the Disney Parks in America will know what i have described would be just unheard of. We would have been fired if we didn't act 'on show'. I would recommend sending some trainers from America over to Paris to show them how it's done.In conclusion, save yourself the disappointment and just save longer to go to Orlando, then you will see the true vision of what Walt Disney was trying to achieve.",0
3847,we were there as 5 kids and 4 adults and entering there we were told we can use our ticket to only one ride for priority and later found it they only have winne the pooh show seperate priority lines that too has limited time entry and a wait time of 1 hour in priority.. by the time we had reached there that line too was closed for the day..in all we cud only do two attractions such was the waiting time..ocean park is much better as we atleast spend time to enjoy rides...felt like cheated ,0
21800,"First went to Disneyland in 1963 and to Disneyworld in 1972. Have returned many times as my children grew up, and as adults without kids, and always loved it. This time we brought our granddaughter for her first visit. She loved it, but we noticed so many things had changed for the worse. Disneyland is so congested and compact that it amplifies the heat. The lineups are so long unless you are there first thing in the morning, and where Disney was famous for making those lines feel as if they move quickly with pre shows etc, now people stand in the heat with no shade. Couldn't even buy a Dolewhip as the lines were too long! Wouldn't you open a second stand or cash register? The kids used to be able to just run up and give the characters a hug, but now the lineups to see them are as long as 2 hours because kids and parents are encouraged to take pictures and get autographs, both money  makers for a Disney, but not very child friendly. You think you could get around this by booking character meals, but even then you wait forever because it takes so long before you can get past the featured character, and then at each table for the character to sign autographs and pose for pictures. The kids are so excited they barely touch their phenomenally expensive meals   the most expensive Mac and Cheese I ever bought   and it had hot dog instead of truffles. The rides were disappointing too. There used to be a storyline and they were so creative and used science so effectively   go to the Muppets movie and StarTours as examples. Now they are predictable   an interesting car to ride in, but then just songs and scenes from the movie. I would have thought they could do so much more. Pirates of the Caribbean has been remade to match the movie. It is so dark and all the fun is gone. Very disappointed in Flik's Fun Fair and Toontown   the jokes seemed aimed at adults, not kids, and the Puddle Park was just a trickle of water from a shower. There are some creative things, with more at California Adventure than Disneyland   Fantasmic, World of Colour, Turtle Talk With Crush, Cars Land, and especially Aladdin   much better than the Broadway show. Stand to the right on Main Street to watch the fireworks   the trees on the left block your view if you are on that side. And why insist everyone stand, which puts the kids at such a disadvantage. Won't go back too quickly, and will never take a child old enough to know about autograph books!",0
37047,"The Disney tag line is Live the Dream. Well I lived a dystopian nightmare during my visit. Nothing could have prepared me for the crowds. Queuing for 2 hours for a five minute ride. In one day no less than four rides we were waiting for broke down, one while we were on it and we had to be 'evacuated'.Food is expensive and very poor, customer focus is completely lacking and although the staff on the ground try to do their best, they are completely overwhelmed by the numbers. Too many tacky gift shops and too few food outlets that allow you to sit down. All the restaurants have to be prebooked so unless you do this you are left with nasty fast food outlets.I felt very sorry for downhearted people with small children who looked exhausted and fractious. This is not a place for the very young.We caught one brief glimpse of a Disney character in the four days we were there. The philosophy behind this venture seems to be to charge exorbitant prices and then pack people in like cattle. In fact if cattle were treated like this in the UK the RSPCA would be up in arms.I would never visit again or recommend this money making machine that has no respect for its customer base.",0
3850,"Hong Kong Disney Land if you have never been to another is fantastic! If you have been in America you will most likely be very disappointed as it is small and hot.For kids upto 15 it can be fun as they relive the adventures of Mickey and Minne, ride and sing It's a Small World Afterall and enjoy hanging out together. I seriously advise checking the weather forecast for the evening as we waited in the best spot  in front of the castle and circular garden  for the night parade for 2 hours only to be told it was cancelled, then they did not move the time of the fireworks earlier, so rather than wait for a total of 5 hours we left at 2000. So check with staff that it going ahead or be prepared to miss it. I really recommend visiting the animation studio where they teach you to draw Disney Characters really easily in air conditioned comfort. Please note the train does not do a full circle tour, even though it announces that it does you have to get off and then line up again at halfway, disappointing when you just want to rest and have a breeze!!",0
9106,"Wife and I visited HK Disneyland on Boxing Day. The place was extremely crowded and the ques for the rides were very long and the RC Racer ride in Toyland took 1 hour !I hv previously visited Disneyland Anaheim and in Tokyo, but HK Disneyland by far is the smallest. Missed the haunted house there.",0
37044,"Recently returned from five days over Christmas at Disneyland Paris with our daughter, son in law and two grandsons aged 5 and 3. Having been twice previously before the grandchildren were born we felt that standards overall have dropped considerably. We stayed as before at the Hotel New York which is now looking very tired and dated. Whilst our bedroom (1122) was clean one of the sinks was badly cracked, the taps were both covered in rust and a light switch on the wall by the bed was hanging off with wires exposed. Characters no longer appear in the hotel as they did previously including Santa Claus which was wonderful and gave excellent photo opportunities for the children. The ice rink was closed which was most disappointing as my family had intended to go skating and was one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Also no hot chocolate in the foyer as in past visits which had been a welcome bonus following a cold day in the Park. On our first morning we had booked the character breakfast which was great as the grandchildren were able to make close personal contact with many of their favourite characters. We'll worth the extra expense particularly as queues on the park to meet characters were horrendous. Turning to the park itself, it was exceptionally busy and the waiting times for some of the rides were too much for young children. Obviously this is not the fault of Disney and the Fastpass system helps but could be available on more rides. The number of shows seems to have been reduced which is disappointing as these were welcome opportunities to take the children out of the cold. Toilets on the park were, frankly, disgraceful with no evidence of any attendants present, any attempt at cleaning or refilling soap dispensers which were empty in many toilets. Frankly this is a serious health hazard and could be the reason why three of our family wit down with stomach bugs. Suggest for anyone thinking of visiting take antibacterial wipes gel with you.On the positive side, the rides, parades and shows do not disappoint. The nightly Christmas Tree lighting is lovely but please bring back the magical Christmas Eve lighting with Santa and a chosen child which was very special. Finally, the closing ceremony is spectacular. My family stood for over an hour in the pouring rain on Boxing Day night and still felt it was well worthwhile and summed up the magic and emotion that is Disney.",0
37043,"I'm pretty certain that if Walt Disney visited Eurodisney today he would ask to have his name removed from the park's name... Long queues everywhere with more than 70 75min waiting time for the best rides (Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Star Wars etc)   3 rides faced technical issues and closed in a day (Indiana Jones, Ratatouille, Disneypark Train). We've been waiting for 70 min on all the above rides and they we were forced to go as they had to shut them down  all announcements are made in French so when there is a technical issue or delay in a ride you don't understand what's happening  cafes and restaurants with ridiculous queues all serving the same menu: burgers, fries, fried chicken. No other options in the entire park  Fast pass tickets sold out within the first hours  No places to rest   benches etc apart from the outside of some restaurants (if they are not packed)  No heaters anywhere (despite the fact that it's set not in Orlando but outside Paris with 0 and below 0 temperatures for 4 months in a year)   Poor customer service done the French way   Bad value for money",0
3852,"For those who have been to LA or Florida, one day here will be enough. It is a real Disney   clean, friendly staff, regular favourite rides   but be ready to experience the stifling humidity. Try and ensure you have the option of the swim available at then end of the day; also be warned that inclement weather caused the cancellation of the night parade both nights we were there",0
33049,"I'm a carer, and I recently supported a lady with autism to Disneyland Paris. Overall, it was wonderful. The park itself is beautiful, there's so much to do. We LOVED the Halloween parade it was awesome. However, there is a reason I am writing this review and unfortunately it's for a negative reason. The lady I supported, as mentioned, has autism, and other mental health issues. To look at her, you wouldn't necessarily know she has 'disabilities' (there is a reason I mention this and I will explain below)...We went to the town hall when we arrived and collected a 'disabled card' (unsure of the correct term) to use on the rides. On here it clearly indicates to all staff why you have the card and states conditions you have, etc. Now  the one thing I have struggled with this whole trip, has been the sheer ignorance, lack of empathy and rudeness from staff. Before i continue I would like to point out  I am not directing this at ALL staff, as we did encounter some absolutely lovely staff during our trip. However, as an avid Disney fan  whose been coming to Disney Land when possible for years, I was genuinely shocked at just how many times we were made to feel inconvenient and belittled. And it's this fact that has compelled me to write this review. Many times we would hand the card to staff and they would look her up and down and say 'what is your disability' and I'd point out that they were stated on the card  and we'd receive eye rolling, sighing, or 'you don't look disabled', on one ride we went on, a member of staff took our card and said 'it is not possible, you are not disabled' DESPITE the fact he has the card in his hand. Another ride we went on a member of staff pointed us to the main queue and said 'you need to go in that queue' I then pointed out the fact we had this card  which we'd already given to her, and she looked the lady I supported up and down and said 'how are you disabled' I again, pointed out it was on the card and she replied 'yes, but HOW are you disabled' the lady I supported replied 'I have special needs' the member of staff replied 'what special about them?' ..now whether there was a language barrier or communication issues at this point  it's possible  but this came across badly and it was beginning to get to the point where the lady I supported wanted to avoid going on the rides because of the possibility we'd encounter a rude member of staff. The lady I supported is very independent and likes to do as much as she can for herself, whilst paying in the 'world of Disney shop' she become anxious and confused as she did not understand what the lady serving us had said to her, and had asked her to repeat it and the woman replied 'what?' Before rolling her eyes and whispering in French to her colleague whilst looking at us. This is a trip she has saved very hard for, and was on her wish list of things to do as she has never been before, so this is an issue that really took the shine off our trip.",0
37005,Old hotel; poor services; long lines; expensive. Some attractions are really nice and funny; others are nothing special. When we went there a lot of attractions were closed.,0
29841,"With a day to    kill    before flying out of Paris my wife and I returned to our childhoods and visited Disneyland Paris. We purchased a mini pass on line, allowing us to enter one of the two parks for one day. The cost per ticked was approx AUD 78.With children from most European countries back to school we half expected the park to be quiet. Having said that I   d read Spanish children do not start school until mid September and we visited the park on 6 September. It seemed every second Spanish child was at Disneyland!!We expected having to queue for rides, but were surprised the waits were up to 60 minutes. What disappointed us was that the ability to bypass queues was not explained to us (in English at least).We waited in a queue for the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad for 50minutes, when with little warning we were told the ride was now closed and they ushered the hundreds of queued customers out of the station. There were no apologies or offers of fast track passes for when the ride was back up and running.Per has we were too old for Disneyland Paris? Or perhaps the reality is that the French don   t do it as well as the Americans?",0
37003,"Having visited the original Disney World many times, we were frustrated with our experienced in Disney Paris.Although some attractions are as nice as in Orlando, a great deal of the experience is related to the care and environment created for the little ones, something that is not a strong feature of the French people.Most workers made no effort to please and didn't even pretend to be part of the attractions, as it usually happens in the original park.In the Indiana Jones coaster, we had 4 people measuring and arguing about our daughter's height, with no concern at all with how she felt. When they finally decided it was ok, she was so scared with the discussion that declined to go.In regard to food, most kiosks were closed. Also, we were not allowed in one of the  quick meal  burger restaurants with a small stroller because there would be a band. Is this Disneyland or Vegas?Many of the attractions focused on little kids were closed or refurbishing, one week after New Years... Autopia, Alice's Labyrinth, Faire Tale Land and The Little Train of the Circle come to mind.The ones open were really good, with special attention to Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Tea Cup and the Big Thunder Coaster.However, without the help of the staff to create the environment, it was not enough for 73 euros (USD 90) each.",0
21849,"We mainly went for the Carsland part of California Adventureland because that is not available in Orlando. The first ride we went on, I had never seen so many line cutters   that was the main cars attraction. I'm told it's one of the more popular rides.I saw a lot of line cutting all over the park in general and in 20 years of going to amusement parks, including major parks in other states, I had never seen that except for here. Apparently they offer locals an annual pass that amounts to $1.50 a day but charge vistors and out of towners about $150 for same thing. I can see why it's over priced. It's really more just for the locals but the lines are very long   even just to see the Disney characters like Mickey or Buzz Lightyear   the line was too long for my little ones to stand. For one of the lines to meet Buzz we left because it's outdoors with no shade and at least a fifteen minute wait   they would have gotten sun burnt.It was a good experience but entirely too overpriced and WAY too overcrowded. It was a shame really.If there is something there you need to see, I would go but plan your trip out and know what you want to do. If you are doing either space mountain or the Lightning McQueen cars race ride, get the fast pass early and go back to the ride later. People blatantly pass you up (pretending to look for a friend when they just don't want to wait in line so they cut to the front).......it's not a great experience.Again   if you are looking for something specific to that park, then go there but if you just want an amusement park experience, go somewhere else. It's cheaper and most likely a lot less crowded.",0
36952,"Compared to the US parks, this is just not the same. Staff often seemed disinterested and lacked the sparkle of their american colleagues. My main issue was smoking in public areas. While this is the cultural norm in France, it is banned in the park with designated smoking areas in place. However, the rule is not enforced at all so expect to have people smoking all over the place which is uncomfortable when you are crowded together in queues or when watching parades. I saw people smoking right in front of other peoples children and cast members who did nothing to enforce the no smoking policy. When I mentioned it to guest relations they told me that they has been instructed not to enforce the policy so as not to upset their majority smoker customer base. ",0
3912,"My husband and I love Disney. Every 5 years, we go to Orlando's Disney World for our Anniversary. We knew HK Disneyland couldn't hold a candle to Orlando's but we wanted to go for a cultural comparison. While this park has my favorite ride (Mystic Manor) and favorite roller coaster (Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars) out of all of the Disney rides I   ve been on, the rest of the park was lack luster. In the defense of the park, it was raining pretty much all day. (Rain has the potential to put a damper on just about anything.) The parade was understandably cancelled due to the weather. They did end up having the fireworks show at closing. The fireworks dwarfed the castle and it was a little humorous to me that the smoke from the fireworks completely hid the castle by the end. If you are in HK and you love Disney, definitely go for the Disney cultural experience. If you are not a Disney fan, this park will not make you become one.",0
3911,"This is the smallest disneyland ever, the staff are very unpleasant! Boring staff! Dissapointed with the refurbishment of tomorrowland! A very small Magic Kingdom! The knky good thing maybe is the transportation by MTR and the shop in the main street section and they have a short fireworks dont waste your time watching that!",0
29857,"Hated the place. An absolute fortune to get in and then rides no better than you would pay   1.50 to go on at a local fair. My granddaughter is 6 and the rides she was able to go on didn't have fast track and the queues were over an hour long. The queue for the extremely poor value for money food was just as bad. Talking to a few people, while we queued, the overall impression is that they don't care about the people going there, they just want your money. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and would give it a minus rating if that was at all possible. My tip is go to the fun fair near the Louvre. The rides are much better and a bargain when compared to Disneyland.",0
36956,I traveled with young teens to celebrate new year. We went via coach innovations that was a wowcher deal. On arrival at the park at 9am after a four hour drive from Calais we thought we would be able to get a breakfast or something decent to eat. Wrong !!! Coffee and muffins were all that was available. We knew it would be busy but didn't expect the crowds we did. A fair few of the larger attractions were broken and out of order. Other rides were up to two hour queuing time. The parks do not cater food outlets for the intake of people. And the choice is stale burgers and fries which is cooked and sat under heat lamps costing 13 euro!!! A small cup of coffee is 2.50 euro. There were a few restaurants but you had to book which we didn't know about. It's really showing signs of wear and tare and old looking. Cracked pavements flaking paint etc. The parades were worth watching. And the only thing you didn't have to que for although the crowds were 10 and more people deep. I made the habit of comparing our visit to one we made to Florida a few years ago. Which to be honest I would say save and go there instead. I was really let down as you expect the whole disney thing to be more magical. The minimal staff that you see floating about are rude and can't be bothered talking to you. The fire work display at nite was average nothing spectacular. Only when I returned did I find out how much debt the parks in Paris are.,0
29856,"The park is out of this world it   s clean tidy they put on amazing shows and the characters are friendly, this place is a very good place to be however, you go to get food, drink maybe a ice cream be prepared to wait a long time, I have never seen anything as slow as the French people serving, ice cream (scoops) into a cone we were in a cue for 30 mins,the cues are out the door, same for dinner, tea, there is no urgency to do anything, there are 2 staff serving 4 watching, it really does ruin your day when you are just waiting, the cues for the rides are standard 45mins to 1 1 2 hours and Disney meet and greet the characters are brilliant when you get there, we cues for an hour and 20 mins, with 2 kids bored hot fed up, Disney need to speed it up, but again it   s slow service all over the park, I would recommend this park if you like cues and would like to waste your time as that   s all you do, more urgency needed, ",0
36959,"We went to the Disney Xmas experience. We didn't get to go on many rides because the queue times were up to 2 hours for most things and as it was raining we didn't fancy standing around in it! The food prices we beyond extortionate and we had to literally wait for somewhere to sit down. The service at all the coffee shops was so slow it was unreal, we were 10 people back in the queue and it took us nearly 25 mins to get 2 drinks!On a positive note we did get to see some of the shows and meet the Disney characters. We really enjoyed the stunt show. As it got dark, all the lights came on and we started to enjoy ourselves a lot more. The queues for the rides got shorter so we managed to get on some! We enjoyed the parade and the firework show at the castle was amazing! If we ever went again it would have to be in term time when its quieter!",0
37002,"Not sure if it was just a timing, but the crowd was huge when we went there. There was a long queue for any rides. Also, there isn't too many rates like any other amusement park.Maybe need two days to cover everything. We went for a day out and enjoyed. We were super tired after the visit.",0
3906,"We had such a great time bouncing with rigger, visiting tarzans tree house and doing  the river ride with gina. It was my first visit in a disneyland and I  expected less than i got.",0
21847,"Nice park, but not nearly as nice as Disney world.  Enjoyed the days spent there.  Tourists and long lines.  Not pocketbook friendly.  A disappointment.",0
3904,it is a smaller scale of the Disneyland compared to Tokyo but a good way to start with if you are with young children. The park tickets are quite pricey.,0
36964,"We enjoyed the variety in our visit to another Disney, but it just wasn't the same experience you have in Florida",0
3903,"We finished all the rides within 1 day. Most queue was less than 20mins, which is good. Overall experience for the rides 6 10",0
15875,Love it but too expensive and crowded. We have passes and its ALWAYS crowded now. It used to be good on some days. Not anymore. Not sure we will renew. Too expensive for what you get.,0
29858,"Firstly I LOVE DISNEYLAND PARIS(we dont usually go when its so busy but it was mine and my sons Birthday weekend so what better excuse to go) but this visit left a less magical glow in my tummy. From the waiting lines to see characters(2 hours to get a photo with Donald Duck? no thanks) The lack of characters(Minnie, Woody, Donald Duck were the ONLY characters we seen throughout the whole park!) and they were only visible behind a line of stressed parents and screaming kids who had clearly waited over a hour  to get a photo.(if you have more than 1 day in this park then fine, wait but we only had 1 day in each park so did not have the whole day to wait around for a photos) The rides were busy as always, its the summer holidays, we expected this but the amount of people we witnessed just pushing into the line was a joke and caused a lot of issues( I am not one to stand back and watch this so a few words were said but the staff just did not seem to care) The parade...hmmmm We expected to see Star wars characters? Maybe a few marvel characters like in the adverts...nope same floats as always...hardly worth the 45 minutes we wasted getting a good viewing spot. I sat my children down at the front along with a lot of other children and most adults stood back so more children could have the best views of the parade but trust me not everyone is as caring! (be prepared for people to just stand in front of you or plonk their kids in front of yours and not give a cr*p! again you have to ask them to move or push them back or your children will not see anything, next time we go we will not waste our time watching the parade unless is Christmas, Halloween ect. The rides are as good as always...Big Thunder Mountain!!! come on, will anyone ever get tired of this ride? we got fastpass tickets at 3pm for this ride for a time slot at 7.30pm so get them early. We did not stay for the fireworks 11pm ( i was gutted) my 7 year old gave up at around 9.30pm, he was tired, cranky and had blisters on his feet from all the walking round so we just headed back to our hotel.",0
15870,Too crowded. Just getting around the park was difficult. Popular rides were booked out by 1 2pm and all other rides had huge queues. Couldn't find many characters either.  Very expensive day and so sad to say....not enjoyable.,0
7866,The rides and all the other attractions are created only for kids. We went with an expectation of a similar experience as Universal studios SG. I guess for that you should try the Ocean Park,0
21855,"We took our 6 year old son to Disneyland (his first time) expecting it to be a magical experience for us all; unfortunately it was anything but magical. We planned and paid for our June trip in January, unaware that June 17 19 was the worst possible time to go. Upon our arrival the first day, we noticed an inordinate number of people...the lines to the rides were 45 minutes to over an hour, although the posted  wait time  was often only 5, 15, or 20 minutes. After the first 2 rides, we asked a Disney  cast member  about the long wait times and seriously large crowd, and she explained to us that this was due to the  day pass  holders trying to get in their last visit(s) before the passes expired...and she added that it would be better for us to come back but not on the 19th because that was  senior day  when all the 2014 grads would be there and it would be even worse. But, we were from out of town and had hotel rooms only through the 19th, so we were stuck. Since we had  fast passes,  we were naively optimistic in thinking that wait times for the 6 rides for which  fast passes  were available would not be an issue since the  fast pass  allows riders to return at an appointed time  with LITTLE or NO wait.  To me, NO waiting means that the riders would pass through the entrance to the ride and walk directly up to the loading area and LITTLE waiting would mean riders would enter and walk up toward the loading area, getting close enough to see people loading and would wait for only a few minutes before being placed on the loading platform or in a seat. Apparently this is not what  fast passes  do. Riders with fast passes approach the entrance to the ride where they may or may not enter immediately...once fast pass riders enter they may walk only a few feet or a few yards, stop and wait... then they eventually make it to the point where they give the fast pass to a Disney  cast member  who will often make them wait before continuing. After this, riders continue toward the loading area where they will again wait before finally loading. Granted, the entire  fast pass  process was faster than what the regular riders endured; however, it was not  LITTLE or NO wait.  We did get lucky on one of our fast passes for Star Tours and waited 14 minutes while the posted wait time was 20 minutes (but it was really close to twice that), but we still waited 70% of the posted time, which I do not consider a  LITTLE  wait. The remainder of our 3 day trip was spent waiting in long lines while watching people cut to join friends and family who had been saving them spots, dodging inconsiderate or inattentive park guests and their stroller wheels as we made our way from ride to ride like salmon swimming upstream, witnessing people enter through exits and then hop the rope railing, and watching rides depart with anywhere from 1 to 4 empty seats time and time again. The one and only time we rode the Matterhorn during our 3 days, we counted enough empty seats in 5 consecutive rides, that an entire ride was wasted. That kind of inefficiency only infuriates people who are trying to wait patiently and enjoy a long awaited vacation in the  magical kingdom . As far as  senior day  goes, it WAS worse. Huge hoards of seniors travelled en masse throughout the park, oftentimes stopping abruptly for no apparent reason and blocking the thoroughfare. They were bay far the worst for line cutting and exit entering. (But we also saw plenty of adults  with their children doing the same.) When we told them not to cut because it wasn't fair to all of us who had been waiting following the rules, they would either glare, ignore, or roll their eyes at us, call us jerks, or try to intimidate us into backing down by puffing up their chest, planting their feet, and staring. When we brought it to the attention of the Disney  cast members  that all this was going on, we were told that they (Disneyland) were doing all they could do to ensure an enjoyable experience for everyone, but that it was hard to catch offenders in the act because there just wasn't enough security to monitor every ride, adding they too did not approve of  senior day  because of the unruly graduates and that the only way to change the situation was to make a formal complaint at Disney's City Hall. So that's what we did. While our complaint was acknowledged and filed, we were politely informed that senior day happens every year and the date is posted on the website, but not as far in advance as January when we made our vacation plans. We, as older parents, have visited Disneyland countless times (as children, teens, and adults,) yet we have never once experienced anything as disappointing as we did on this last trip. Luckily our son didn't know any better since this was his first experience at Disneyland; however he did remark that during our 6 days at Lagoon in Salt Lake City the wait time for rides was basically nonexistent in comparison. We will return to Disneyland, but we will make sure it is well before day passes expire, California schools are out for the summer, and seniors get their  special day  at the park.",0
9086,The themepark is great. It is not Disney's fault that the visitors are rude and unorderly. Children and adults tried to push past us to cut in line every minute of the day. Will not return.,0
31511,Visited when it rained in the morning only lace to shelter is the shops.. None of the character s we're available. Parades shows were cancelled or delayed so long that ckids got bored. Biggest waste of money. Go to a non Disney theme park that has decent rides. Kids will have a better day,0
6695,"If you have extra money to burn and extra time to kill and have never been to another amusement park   then you might enjoy this one. If you have ever been to almost any other park   and if you are from the USA and have even been to a large county fair   you will be disappointed. The few rides there are are very short (slinky dog ride in Toy Story land only made 6 loops around the tiny track, swinging race car ride only swung 3 times). Space Mountain is not similar at all to the one in Orlando, and the two other rides geared more towards older kids (Grizzley Gulch roller coaster and Mystic Manor) were both closed due to technical issues the day we were there. This park does not have that many rides that are of interest to kids over the age of 8 9. Mickey's Philharmonic show was good. We went during the Halloween special time of year and did go through one of the walk through haunted houses and it was ok, but the line was so long for the second walk through haunted house we did not go to it (over an hour wait). The scary storytelling session was  sold out  so fast we did not get to go to it either.The food at this park is way below expectations for a Disney Park. At the suggestion of the staff members (who we ask where are the best places to eat), we went to Royal Banquet Hall and also at the Explorers Club. We are very open to new foods   seek them out in fact   but Disney did not come through with these offerings   blah, and uninspired.Staff members were nice and honest. They told us a one day pass was enough, not to buy two. They told us to just buy 2 of the special 3 for 1 price dining coupons and share with our kids   and they were right that was the best thing to do (guess they knew we would be less than impressed with the food). Restroom on the Tarzan Treehouse Island was in terrible condition (dirty). Other restrooms we went to were acceptable.Over all, unless you are a huge Disney fan and want to check this off as a Disney Status been there   done that park type thing, pass this up and go to another amusement park.We went on a Friday in October and the weather was great, the lines for rides (the ones that were open!!) were good in the morning, but by 2 by they were silly long.",0
29863,From the magic bus driver to the hotel and park staff I have to say I was utterly shocked by their attitudes and the fact that they were just utterly rude! They weren   t helpful in any way and for me it just ruined the experience! I didn   t think that the rides were great! Definitely in need of an update! Over priced and poor experience I say! Wouldn   t go again! Even my 4 year old was unimpressed!,0
29865,"I   m no keyboard commando or travel writer   just a parent trying to give the best experiences to our family. So, straight to the point Disneyland Paris ROCKS! But this year they have introduced a system managed by an app called Lineberty for the Meet    n    Greets and its an EPIC FAIL. The online queue opens at 10:45 for The Incredibles and Captain America, earlier for Mickey and Toy Story. We   ve just spent 6 days at the park and tried obsessively to get a booking to see the Captain as this is our son   s hero. This was three people constantly refreshing almost obsessively to get a time and it took us 6 days to get one. Here   s the problem   every time you think that it   s allocated you a slot the sodding system chucks you out! it   s the biggest stressor we experienced all week. I kid you not, we witnessed parents in tears trying to negotiate to get a Meet    n    Greet. This isn   t acceptable and I hope that Disney has received enough bad feedback about it that it changes its booking procedure. Even the staff members were negative about it. Secondly, staff. Disney seems to have two types of employee; those who love their job and are amazing and others who frankly are so miserable and rude that they need to be retrained or replaced, it can   t be difficult to find people who WANT to be part of the magic making team. Finishing off, Disney is still wonderful and nobody does shows like them; the Mickey and the Magician show was brilliant. I hope that they don   t continue to tarnish the experiences that their customers have, and that the Lineberty system either gets suitably refined and fair or replaced with a better replacement. ",0
3923,"Disappointed to say the least with most of Tomorrow land closed for refurbishment. Not only that but a lot of food outlets were closed as well it was even a challenge to get a drink of water.Take a ride on the train to have a look around only to discover it's just a half journey you disembark and queue again, not that you would bother you only see the fence and trees!If you want to see fireworks go to river fire in Brisbane where Movie world and Dreamworld are better attractions.",0
13930,"Unfortunately the park was very crowded. The wait period to get on the rides was at least 90 minutes. Although Disneyland is a magical place the lines to buy food, get on rides and watch the parades is overwhelming. I loved the Christmas themes, but definitely you need alot of patience. I believe for the price it is very unfortunate you really don't get your monies worth. I saw alot of children crying because they were tired if awaiting in.lines definitely a challenge for parents. As a couple we did enjoy walking around and enjoying the atmosphere. ",0
26006,"We visited Disneyland on August 18th and 19th, 2012. I was shocked by how rude so many of the Disney  Cast  were during our visit. We got in line for the new  Cars  ride and waited for 45 minutes before the ride was shut down temporarily and were told to leave the line (along with everyone else).We then went over to Toy Story and waited in that line at least 35 minutes before it shut down. They announced that everyone should leave the line. I was hot, tired and had just wasted more time waiting for a ride with my family so I approached the Disney person standing at the front of the ride shouting that people need to leave the line. I asked about being given a fast pass since we had been waiting. She very rudely told me that only people that had reached a certain point in line would get a fast pass and then ignored me. I asked an employee standing in front of the Tiki House what time the next show started. He replied  8:30pm . When I asked him if he knew what the current time was he said no and walked off.Lots of Disney employees shouting at people to  Move out of the way!  etc. No  Please , no  Thank You . If we approached an employee about directions to a ride or about anything else we were treated as though we were bothering the employee.It was like Disney had been taken over by Walmart employees that hate their jobs. It was COMPLETELY different then our experience at Walt Disney World where every employee we came into contact with played their role as a  Happy Disney Cast Member  to perfection.The people checking tickets at the main gate are pretty rude as well. It was very weird but perhaps that's typical for Disney in California?",0
29868,"Before I begin this review I must warn I feel unfortunately, there will be more negative points than positive.I   ll begin with the positives  I went on this trip with Mum, Sister and my 4 year old niece. My nieces reactions to Disneyland itself and the characters was wonderful  she absolutely loved it. And on a whole this made the trip for me.  the    spectacularly sparkly Disney illumination show    is impressive (however I would recommend going at least 1 hour if not more before it begins to find some sort of space). some** of the    cast members    were brilliant. It was nieces 4th Birthday during the trip and she had her princess dress on and some** of them were so kind to her, and addressed her as    princess    and she kept saying    am I a real princess now?   ... lovely. One cast member played Mickey Mouse singing happy birthday to her, when we arrived they allowed her to choose a present for a birthday and she chose a balloon, and another cast member made it possible for her to get a free ice cream and he called other cast members over to sing happy birthday to her  which was also lovely. we had dinner at the New York hotel one night and it was a really nice buffet.  we stayed at Sequoia Lodge and it was great being such a short walk from the park. Negatives   queues: There were horrifically long queues for everything  the rides, the restaurants, the food carts, the statues around the park... literally everything.  on the subject of queues... the times they put outside the rides...add onto whatever it says because it   s a very vague time. We queued for a few rides that said    50 60 minutes    and ended up queueing for over an hour and a half.  also, the app... the ride times are not reliable In the slightest.  we queued for nearly 3 hours to see 1 princess at the princess pavilion. And we found it wasn   t uncommon that people would have one person in their family wait in the queue then come later when that family member was at the front of the queue, then people were pushing and stepping over to get through the queue to the front. Which not only added onto the queueing time, but it also meant people were being stood on  myself included. WARNING: Rude people  everywhere. Absolutely everywhere. I don   t want to imply anything  so I will just vaguely say that the ignorance and rudeness we have encountered from other visitors to the park on this trip is vast. And it seems we were not alone with this when speaking to many other families during our trip.  At the age of 25, I am a huge Disney fan. I have been to Disneyland Paris 5 times over the past few years. This is the first time I have been during the summer holidays, and it will be my last time going in the summer holidays. I have never seen it this busy, and it certainly takes some of the magic out of the experience. If you can avoid it, I wouldn   t recommend going at this time of year. ",0
36936,"I am a disney lover, so I did love going to a new park. The parades, shows, christmas decorations, and character greetings lacked some of the special disney effects I have known to love. The parade was short, the show was small and simplistic, and there was a significant lack of characters in general. The rides themselves were very fun. They are a lot more intense then magic kingdom rides, so be prepared! Feel free to read more at our blog: http:  haustiereundmenschen.blogspot.no 2014 11 disneyland paris thanksgiving and.html",0
6691,One of the Disneyland staff in the Main St. Store reprimanded my son when he was playing with the velvet ropes while my wife was lining up to pay for all the Disney merchandise that we got from the same shop. My son was 5. The staff probably realized his mistake and gave my kid a free sticker. But still. ,0
3929,There is really nothing much to see. We thought it will take us full day to see everything here but we finished all the possible rides within 4 hours. It is a small Disney land.,0
36933,"We've stayed here a few years ago and had a much better experience then. I remember eurodisney being the hight of customer service, with everyone in staff adding to the  magical  experience, from the janitor to the reception and the characters.Now, staff looks tired and run down. Characters were nice to our daughter (4) when they were in their role, but ignored her when she spotted them walking to their destination. No explaining to a child why  King Louis  was obviously ignoring her (quiet area, she was yelling and pleading, he's her favorite Disney character). It was little things like this that just made the experience less  childhood dream  and more  mcDonalds . Housecleaning in the hotel threw her teddy bear onto our bed (he was face down with arms and legs mixed up). For a children's destination, I would expect them to tuck him in or at least put him nicely on her bed. It's a small amount of energy that makes all the difference. I know it sounds nit picky... I don't mean to be, but it was an accumulation of things like this that made it very noticeable that Disney was no longer  Disney . They didn't replenish the shower gel (we left the one tiny empty container out in plain sight, apparently they thought we should use only one between the three of us for three nights). They didn't say good morning or even acknowledge us when we met housecleaning in the hallway. Even when we said goodmorning to them. Our room was extremely cold, the windows were drafty, the heater wasn't working properly, the ventilation seemed bad. After a shower the room stayed wet with condensation for a long time. It smelled musty and was uncomfortable for sleeping. On our last night we discovered the bathroom was leaking quite badly and our daughters bed was on a large wet spot of carpet. When we mentioned it at our checkout the reaction wasn't very interested. I left wondering if they would even fix it. This being sequoia lodge, it was all the more surprising. We've had good experiences here in the past. To be fair, they tried to fix the heater on the first day, it just didn't seem to do much good.In the park, the rides were often stopped. One ride didn't work at all and we were told to get back in line, behind the queue that already formed to wait another 45 mins. The food was meh.... Especially for vegetarians there was little to get happy about. When my little one busted her lip playing with a fence, there was staff of a ride standing a meter away. They kept on talking to each other, barely acknowledging the screaming and panicking little girl with a bloody mouth next to them. They didn't offer a handkerchief or even a smile. I was let out of line with some unease and left to my own devices. I'll manage, but I had expected differently. On the positive, the Christmas activities are beautiful. The tree, the parade, the fireworks... Beautiful. Our concierge was really good, giving us blankets and new shower gel when we asked. We had a really nice dinner show at Buffalo Bill and a great experience at the restaurant of Ratatouille. But, what used to be  Disney  all round, is now something you occasionally find, making the experience decidedly less magical. It definitely felt like we were being herded around in mass entertainment (which obviously is true, but it was less noticable in previous experiences) and that no one could care less how our experience was.Being a Disney fan and very excited to see it at Christmas time and share it with my little girl... It was, to be honest, a little disappointing. The park and staff seem run down, the food a notch less good than before, the customer service quite a bit down from before, the rides breaking down a little too often, parts of the park (especially in Studios) looked neglected. I'm not sure when and if I ever want to go back. I sent them an email stating this (careful to let them know that I didn't want a refund or compensation) I got no reply yet. It just solidifies my idea that they could care less. So, if you are a Disney fan, you don't mind being herded around and are able to gloss over a myriad of little things... You'll be fine. The new rides are really nice, Ratatouille's ride is awesome, Crush's Coaster is really cool. But, if you go there to experience the  magic of Disney , you might be disappointed. Seems like new management has different views on what that magic entails.UPDATE: I got a package and letter from them this week stating they were taking my comments very seriously. They went above and beyond to make up for it, offering us compensation and a beautiful doll for my daughter. It really wasn't something I was aiming for, but it was really nice of them to do this. An email stating they would try to solve some of the issues would have been enough, so this is much more than expected. My idea that they could care less has certainly been disproven. I still stand behind my review, but am very glad they are trying to improve on these things, or that they are apparently just a case of bad luck on our part. Just wanted to let you know this.",0
3901,We went to Hong Kong in May during school vacations and Disneyland was an obvious choice for us to include in our itinerary. It was nice and pleasant and kids enjoyed it obviously. Though having seen the US Disneyland I realized that this was an abridged version. Not everything is here which in some ways is ok as it's possible to actually cover the whole park in a day. Food options are a bit limited for vegetarians. ,0
9089,"Smaller than Florida's, but we were only there to kill time before a flight home",0
15877,"Well Disney is always a great place to be for grown ups and kids all ages. Lines are daunting , but the only thing I would really advise you to do is to check the weather for that day especially if you're going for a one day visit. Our one day visit was not a big success, it rained and poured for about 2 hours or so,and of course no rain rainchecks there, then some shows and rides were canceled and they also canceled the fireworks!!!",0
3884,"If you have been to the Disney parks in USA, expect this to be a very mini version of those. The rides are smaller as well. Unfortunately it was missing the splash mountain ride. :( Despite the size, still enjoyed ourselves. Do not miss the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars ride, by far the best ride in the park.Disney is still the happiest place regardless of the size. :)",0
37001,"Travelled here in December 2014 with my little girl, parents and two friends. It was supposed to be magical for my little girl. On our first night (we were there only a few hours!) we went for some food in the Plaza Gardens restaurant where you are directed to leave your buggy in the designated Area. When we came back after our meal we discovered my little girls buggy had been stolen!I Immediately reported this at county hall, to which staff informed me unfortunately it does happen. I was left to carry my little girl around the next day whenever she was tired or pay to rent a buggy even though we were the victims of crime. They offered no help and it was down to me to check in for updates or information. I walked to the police station to report the theft which took over 3 hours before I was dealt with, then onto Val de Europe where I had to purchase a new buggy. I also purchased a lock and whenever I had to leave the buggy I locked it to barriers. I would strongly recommend anyone travelling with a buggy to bring a lock and do the same. There are a lot of people doing it so you won't look out of place.The staff were horrendous and of no help at all other then telling me 'unfortunately this happens but we can't do anything to stop it' I am still waiting on a reply the past number of weeks having lodged a complaint So if you want to save yourself the hassle and keep your buggy safe, lock it! I wish I had this info before I travelled. I referred to these pages a lot before I left. We lost a whole day in the park due to no buggy,police station and shopping centre not to mention the extra cash spent on the buggy.",0
9097,Small park but pleasant and fun. Food inside the park is rather good. Hollywood hotel is nice but crowded and check in time is 3pm!,0
36999,"I understand that Disney Paris is only partially owned by Walt Disney, but I would figure that they'd be in touch enough to know and enraged about how short it falls from the two parks in the US.First of all, it seemed as though people smoked just about anywhere they pleased. I understand that it's Paris and not the US but still   it has Disney's name on it. Next, a good chunk of our time was wasted in line waiting for rides that ended up breaking down. Wait or move on? That was a crapshoot. Sometimes they'd be fixed within a half hour and we'd be on our way. The other half of the time we were told  ferme  (broken) and were told to move along. This happened A LOT with the major attractions that we tried to visit. Some were broken the entire time we were there.Third, the general upkeep was not up to California and Florida Disney standards. It pained me to see the amount of cigarette butts and general trash that was not picked up by park operators.Finally, the cost of the meals seemed outrageous. In California or Florida it was a little inflated   it was a captive audience scenario after all   but in Paris it seemed that we couldn't get away with a meal for 4 that ran under 3x what we paid in the US. The very poor quality of the food was also a major bummer   especially for what we paid.We would not, under any foreseeable circumstances, choose to visit again based on the poor quality of our first go around. Too bad.",0
36998,"The biggest advice I have from our recent trip is to make reservations for meals. We walked up to the oriental buffet expecting to be seated, and were told to return in 90 min for our reservation. We rolled with it and had a very nice lunch. We then thought we would get ahead of things and make our reservation for dinner. When we arrived, the line to make a reservation was SO LONG I thought people were waiting to enter to eat. We skipped it and returned at 7 pm. We waited for 30 min, but no one was seated without a reservation in that time. The line beside us of people WITH reservations barely moved. We tried a second restaurant, but they were fully booked as well. We gave up and went to the  deli  spent too much money on too little food, and looked for a place to sit. There wasn't one. So we walked out, and found a few tables, where we sat in the cold and watched the snowflakes fall.  I wish we had known there were restaurants just outside the gate near the train station. All in all, while Disneyland Paris is very much like Orlando in many respects service isn't one of them.",0
36997,I visit Disney most years at the beginning of December. This year it was very evident how scaled back everything was Smaller and less fantastic parades. The same parade 3 times a day and very few characters in the park. Equally my kids used to love seeing the characters in the hotels at breakfast this was stopped in October I was told. I think they need to remember that Disney can be magical but I have to say this year didn't feel that way at all,0
36996,"We always go to disney USA (orlando) but thought we would pop over to see euro disney at Christmas.Well I think USA disney need to get over to France and kick some butts!First the smoking from people is dreadful,obviously the designated smoking spots are not used or doesn't apply to the French. People even smoking in queues ,disney staff don't give a toss.this is a park full of kids if they aren't bothered about their own kids have some respect for other peoples kids.There is none of the customer care that goes without saying in the USA. The staff are surly . chewing gum all over the place and cigarette butts,chipped pain and dirty rides. This would never happen in USA. The whole place is like the pound shop does disney !! Obviously the disney rule book has been tossed out and not followed in France. Save your money and go to a proper Disney park in USA",0
36995,"In my opinion Disneyland Paris has really gone down hill in recent years.We found that guests were not sticking to the smoking areas and no one did anything about this. We also found there was still lots of queue jumping going on with no staff preventing this from happening. Lots of rides were breaking down, in two days I think Aerosmith, Peter Pan, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, Toy Story and Thunder Mesa all broke down for a few hours at a time, there may even have been more we didn't see. Also a lot of rides that have fast pass facility didn't have the fast passes in use, which was frustrating.The park just needs a general clean and tidy up. Food prices are very expensive, your looking at 20 30 EUR for two people to eat burger, chips and a drink, much better off wandering to McDonalds or Starbucks in Disney Village. The park is still magical and the rides are still brilliant. The snow and the music and the atmosphere at Christmas is simply amazing but I do think things have changed there. It would be nice to see characters walking around like they used to rather than having to queue at several points around the park to meet them. The toilets were also disgusting, staff were doing the best to keep on top of things but you could go into a block and find not a single one was useable.I can imagine at peak Christmas season everything would have been a bit of a nightmare as queues would have been huge, we got there just before the rush! I would still recommend going but Disneyland Paris doesn't even begin to compare to the experience in the USA.",0
21826,The fireworks and the parade were very fun but the lines on certain rides and the lack of trill rides is what really dropped the rating.,0
9096,"Unless you're a big fan of Disney, this HK Disney park is not really that fun.The shows are quite good, but the rides and other things to do are not really something worth spending money and half a day for. Fireworks were good, but not that amazing.It's not that terrible, we just felt that we should've stayed in the city proper and explored there instead, afterall, we came to HK for the uniques HK culture, sights and food. The park did not really show the uniqueness of Hong Kong, so you can just go to other amusement parks, especially if you're not travelling with kids. Enjoyed Ocean Park way more.Don't think I'm coming back here.",0
21828,"We have just visited Disneyland park in Anaheim (June'24, 2014). The first time we had visited this park was in 2002. So, more than 12 years passed. Nothing changed, only the price skyrocketed. The high price however did not change the park to a better one. No matter what time we go to this park I have the same sad experience of visiting the UNHAPPIEST place in the world. Each time, I give myself a promise to never come back. But, guests come and we have to go there and visit this so called California trademark. The place has so many parking places but not enough space for people. You can easily park your car, however it is impossible to park yourself within the park. People walk around the park as zombies from place to place hoping to get into a ride. However, the wait time to any ride is 90 minutes on average. There is no a single empty place to seat. There is no place to even stand in the shade. You just have to walk in circles with the feeling that you are like a crazy animal in a zoo. Only, it is a zoo for humans for which you pay to be in. I strongly advise all of you reading this comment not to visit this park. Their so called  future world  actually lies somewhere 15 30 years in the past.",0
15890,"Visited Disneyland in Anaheim in March this year, was gob smacked at the entry prices!! I'm not sure how the locals can afford to go here. It cost us $300 dollars for two people for one day park hoppers for both Disneyland and adventure park. Both parks do not offer the fast pass system that is offered in Florida. To get a quick queue ticket, you have to walk all the way up to the attraction and queue to get a quick queue ticket! You then get allocated a time slot for later in the day. You then cannot get another quick queue ticket for two hours! Park is old and needs updating especially in technology. There is no wifi at the park. There is a wide range of food outlets but again all over priced and not great quality. Park is very small compared with Disney world in Florida which is quite nice as you can get from attraction to attraction quickly but also due to it being small there are ride queues everywhere which can making moving around difficult. They have some OK rides, but they also have some dreadful ones hyperspace mountain being the worse and it had a queues constantly of 2 hours!! It is just space mountain which the word hyper added, was so disappointed!! Would not visit again, once is enough. ",0
3883,"If you've ever visited Hong Kong Disneyland, I think you would agree with me that it's the smallest Disney park in the world.Most of the attractions are for small children or teenagers. Not so many rides for adults.The souvenir prices are slightly exaggerated and more expensive than other Disney parks.Tips: Don't visit the park during monsoon season and public holidays in China and Hong Kong. I would assure you that you will waste your time there for queueing.",0
36989,"Went for 4 days over New Year for a magical break turned into more of a nightmare.Queued for rides for over an hour (some had 2 hour queues) then to be told ride had broken down and your herded out of the line up, this happened 3 times to us on New years eve by 2pm had not been on 1 ride!! Food all across the park is the same and awful. you have a choice of pizza, hot dogs, burger or chicken nuggets, all cheaply made and tasteless.Too say the park is expensive is an understatement you just feel your being ripped off. 2 x very small hot drinks and the equivalent of 1 happy meal of chicken nugget and fries was 13 Euros! water, coke all 3 Euro's and bottled not in cups. No characters walking around only in selected spots and then queues of over an hour to have a photo taken (glad I didn't take kids!) The castle display on New years eve was a big let down very poor hardly any fireworks, the display on New years day at 10pm was 100 times better! Bizarre!! I have read some of the other reviews of people who went over new year and I have to agree its sad to say the French have got it soooo wrong! the staff have bad attitudes, grumpy service, smoking and on mobile phones is common across the park.Trying to book a restaurant on New years eve took nearly two hours, passed from pillar to post eventually told after an hour of queuing in two separate locations that I have to call a central number for any restaurant even in the village, then spent 30 minutes hanging on the phone to book a table in the steak restaurant in the village. I was then asked to pay upfront 170 euro's per head for steak and chips in a school dinner hall, Rip Off? I think so, I declined the booking. Overall very disappointing visit, the French have missed the point of Disney having been to Disney land in Florida twice I can judge. Its worlds apart. Personally I would say for what this cost save your money and go to Florida its beyond compare in every way. If you do want to go or have booked here's some tips.Eat in the village 5 6pm no queues, at 7 8pm you will join queues of over a two hour wait out the restaurant into the village. Drinks in the sports bar in the village are reasonably priced for the venue, ie bottle of Frexinet 25 euro'sWrap up warm this time of year especially your feet, no where to warm up and you get cold very quickly standing around in queues for hours on end with no heaters. Wear thermal socks, hats and scarfs and lots of layers. Fill up on breakfast and try to skip lunch in the park its awful and a rip off.If its busy get to park early and find the machines near each ride where you put in your park ticket in and get issued a fast pass to come back later, you can do this once on every ride and may save you queuing for hours on end. Hope this helps.Park was rammed ",0
36988,"This was my fourth visit to Disneyland Paris having been previously in 2001, 2007 and 2009 and it has always been a magical enjoyable experience, always looking forward to our next visit. We also visited the resort in Anaheim California in 2012 which was amazing. However we left feeling very disappointed after our most recent visit to Disneyland Paris.The main park now sadly seems very run down and tired, with cutbacks in the number of attractions and shows, with rides regularly breaking down. and the smoking!! I have never seen so many people smoking in a public place, even while standing in queues for rides with small children around, with no staff members enforcing the smoking policy.We always avoid the food outlets in the park which are frankly a rip off. We always take a packed lunch to snack during the day, which usually consists of rolls, croissants and other items from breakfast, and we take our own bottled water. Who wants to spend ages in a queue for junk food and fizzy drinks?We have been spoilt on previous visits with numerous parades throughout the day, including an electrical parade, shows and quality stage performances, Disney characters just wandering around the park to meet and greet you. Now there seems to be one parade a day, no live shows, and Disney characters nowhere to be seen. After about the third day having been on most of the rides we were getting bored! The only real highlight was the Disney Dreams show at the end of the day which was fantastic.The rides are still good, but again with a lack of maintenance they didn't seem as good as before. I compared a video I shot of Pirates of the Caribbean ride back in 2007 to what it was now, and half the animatronics don't seem to work any more, now just static figures. We were stuck on Autopia for some time as one of the cars broke down. We also had fast passes for Buzz Lightyear one day but missed out as it was closed due to a 'technical problem'. More of the popular rides would also benefit from having Fastpass, despite numerous visits I have still never had a chance to go on the Finding Nemo ride, always a ridiculous queue!This is a far cry from the Disney experience you get at Anaheim. That park is almost 60 years old but it feels brand new, the staff are friendly, all rides working (and if they don't work, they are closed down and fixed   not leaving people stranded). queues move quickly, and a strict smoking policy where people actually smoke in the designated areas! on another note, Anaheim has much better Parade etiquette, where people at the front sit down on the pavement, so people behind can see. Unlike Disneyland Paris with everyone standing up and pushing and shoving to get the best view, also plenty of places to sit down. I overheard one Cast Member talk about Disneyland Paris being the 'poor relation' out of all the Disney parks! Have the appropriate Disney authorities actually inspected Paris in recent years? surely there are standards that must be maintained?You expect to go to Disneyland for a magical experience and come away smiling and only feeling sad because the holiday is over. I came away feeling conned, with smelly clothes and a bad cough. cheers Disney.I hear there are plans for an upgrade to DLP in 2017 for the 25th Anniversary, such as a new Star Tours ride. This is welcome news and I hope they also factor in a major cash injection to refurbish the rest of the park and bring back more of the parades and shows.It's a pity they never built the park in Spain which I think was the original plan, it would have been far better I think and and not just because of the better weather. Building in France I think was financially motivated, shame they went with the scheme and not the dream : (",0
36986,"Decided to go one day to Disney Paris. VERY easy to get to on the RER, about a 40 minute ride. We bought the zone 5 Mobilis ticket which was good all day long. We got there around 9:30 am. You get dropped off right at the gate which is great. Lines were not long at all to buy your ticket on a cold December Saturday. As you've read, the smoking in the park is outta control! Mon Dieu, smoking everywhere, and people are just tossing their butts all over the place. Not the neat and tidy parks you are used to, if you've been to Disneyland Resorts in the states. The other odd thing, is that we could not find working water fountains, not sure if there was a problem that day we went, or if water is intentionally turned off so that you have to purchase drinks. Food and drink in this park is expensive, as it is in other parks, but it's just not very tasty. I saw lots of what I assume were locals just eating their own lunch. Not only is the food expensive, but you would think being in Paris food would be a little better...it's not. We didn't eat at any of the buffets, just got a sandwich on Main Street. No carts selling corn dogs, turkey legs, chowder bowls, or some french specialty like escargo, or croissants here. Maybe buffets are better, but at nearly $35 or $40, they ought to be. Rides were OK, Space Mountain is WAY faster than the one in DL Resort in Anaheim. The Aerosmith Steve Tyler roller coaster was great as well. Glad we went, and no regrets, but definitely not returning.",0
33059,"Went yesterday. Middle of October, still ridiculous queues, some attractions out of service. Food in the pizza and pasta place was poor and ludicrously exensive. This is classic American capitalism with faux welcomes delivered by surly French staff to whom joie de vivre does not, ironically, come naturally. Be prepared to pay hundreds and hundreds of pounds to be treated like cattle by people who do not even pretend to care. The parade at the end is worth seeing but not at the extortionate rate Disney charge.",0
31517,"I visited Disney Paris in 2001, 2005 and last month. Nothing new since my last visit. Same old technology, same attractions. Even the 3D movie (star wars) is still the same. That was somthing interesting 10 years ago but you can find the same now at you local village shopping mall. The queues are still long enough to kill the day. But you end up with an old fashioned attraction. They made no investment since my last visit 12 years ago. But they added a lot of new shops selling chineese Disney stuff for a fortune. On the day of our visit there was rain and they cancelled the shows at the last minutes without acknowledging visitors waiting for hours under the rain. Meanwhile they sold thousands of raincoats (for 10 EURs which you may find for 3 4 Euros at the city)....It was a promise that I gave to my doughter to visit Disneyland but was really not the place I visited 12 years ago (or it was exactly the same old place but shoudn't be)...I believe that there are much more interesting amusement parks in Europe and this place is just targeting to get as much money as they can from you...",0

29846,"Disneyland Paris suffers from the same pitfalls as Disneyland California   small park, high demand. The crowds are awful and the lines for food bathrooms are a nightmare. But if you don   t eat and never need to use a bathroom during your entire visit it   s probably pretty great. The Ratatouille ride that everyone raves about in the Studios park I found underwhelming; I   m not a thrill rider, but I was told by my companion that Space Mountain and Big Thunder are particularly great attractions that have some unique draws among their Disney park brethren. Phantom Manor was closed during our visit, which was a major disappointment. I enjoyed the walk through attractions like the dragon under Sleeping Beauty   s castle. We stayed open to close, which was grueling, but nothing beats riding the Orbitron at the end of the night with the fireworks going off in the background. And the crowds don   t stop when you leave the park! If you stay until close, be prepared for a cozy standing room only train ride back to Paris with all your tired, hungry compatriots.",0
29847,"Disneyland is a money making machine so there is no excuse for the extremely poor effort made to cater for people with dietary conditions. My 8yo son was effectively left to eat cold baby food, it's the only way I can describe their awful menu for people with dietary conditions. Just simple alterations could make all the difference, it's not rocket science or difficult to do.Disneyland Paris is an amazing place, but they rip you off for substandard food & an absolute disregard for guests with dietary conditions. ",0
36981,"I enjoyed it BUT.......there's a lot of smoking going on everywhere, in ride queues, food queues and just generally walking around. There are designated smoking areas but no one takes any notice. When you don't smoke yourself and have young children who have to breathe in the fumes it's hard to stomach. Being stuck behind someone for an hour and a half whilst queueing for a ride is NOT a good holiday experience.My advice is to reserve restaurants in advance as it's the best way to meet characters they come to you (and the foods not bad or that expensive). If you have to queue to meet Mickey et al you will wait a very long time, and to be honest in the four days we were there I only saw three character meet opportunities and the lines were horrendous!The parade is very short, all that roping off and possibly being stuck next to a smoker means it's possibly not even worth the trouble, take advantage and go on the rides, the wait times will be negligible. We did the queue for Its A Small World in 2 minutes whilst the parade was going on as opposed to 40 minutes when it wasn't!The Anna and Elsa parade consists of the two characters in a coach pulled by two horses to the sound of Let It Go being played VERY loudly, and that's it, a total waste of time even for 6 year old girls who love it, and I thought their wigs were the worst I have ever seen! On the plus side there are many good shops, places to eat and rides, Ratatouille was the best (with a corresponding lengthy queue).The last time I was here was ten years ago and I think it'll be another ten years before I go again.",0
36980,"The park normally has about 15000 visitors a day,this weekend there were over 50000 on both Saturday and Sunday.on Sunday many rides eg dumbo did not open until 10am.we were staying over so had magic hours,not a lot of use if a number of attractions do not open til 10am.Even the coffee kiosks weren't open.",0
13131,"My daughter and I had a couple of days in Anaheim at the end of a 2 week trip to LA, and considering we went to Tokyo Disneyland only a couple of months ago, we had the luxury of skipping some of the rides in Disneyland that we had already been on and didn't need to go on again. So we opted for a 1 day park hopper. I realise that's the most expensive option, but I didn't want to spend another USD100 for us to have a 2nd day just for the sake of making it a more economic option.Even so, I really can't see how Disneyland can justify charging USD179 each (AUD255) to stand in huge lines waiting. Yes, I realise now it was spring break. But a theme park should be able to handle its busiest times, and I really don't think Disney can. Or is it that everyone just loves standing in lines and queuing for things? That was one thing that my daughter and I couldn't believe   the lines of people queuing for absolutely everything. Maybe queuing is something that Australians just don't like to do?Based on recommendations from friends, we made sure we were at the gate by 7.30ish, lining up with everyone else. As soon as the park opened, we went straight to California Adventure Park to get some rides in before heading over to Disneyland at 10.30am.We immediately got a Fast Pass for the Indiana Jones ride   glad we did, because it was still a 5 6 hour wait until we could use it. And when we did, we immediately got a 2nd FastPass. It's a bit deceiving by skipping what you think is the queue, when you hand in your FP. But there is still quite a long way to go after that point, and still lots of queuing to do. Despite this, it was our favourite ride.During the course of the day, we got FastPasses where we could, but otherwise didn't wait in lines any longer than 30 minutes. So that means that we missed out on some rides that we would have really liked to go on (like Pirates). We thought the crowds would die down towards the end of the night, but even at 11pm, the stand by line for Indiana Jones was still over an hour.The food offerings were expensive   USD10.75 (AUD15) for a pack of caramel popcorn? Thanks but no thanks. If I went again, I would definitely take my own food.Comparing Disneyland to its counterpart in Tokyo, we would go back to Tokyo in a heartbeat   so much cleaner, more spacious, less crowded, much shorter lines.Overall, I was disappointed with the day, and won't bother coming back next time I'm in the US.",0
29849,"The park was crowded even in an yellow orange rated day. A lot of rides were either broken or in maintenance, and even the best ones, like the Aerosmith Rock'n Roller Coaster, Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean and Star Wars hyperspace Mountain.We spent our fast pass in the Big Thunder Mountain, which got closed while we were in the fast pass queue to enter it, due techinical problems! And it was not solved that day! And due the time restrictions, we were unable to reschedule it.The Fireworks show was too late, when we reached the metro station in Paris, the metro was already shutdown, take care when planning it.If you already visited the Florida parks, don't waste your time. Even the queues in the Florida parks are funnier than the Paris' parks.",0
21837,"We've been coming to Disneyland for years. Noticed a poor trend in overall service. A lot of the staff are unfriendly and great at quoting statements about how the customer is wrong. A lot if the employees are older adults and should probably retire. They just seem miserable being at what should be the happiest place on earth. Space Mountain, Nemo and Alice in Wonderland are all closed for refurbishment. Had we known we wound have delayed our trip. I suggested they put a notice online when you purchase tickets to advise guests. Was told it's my responsibility to check what attractions are closed before buying tickets. Really??",0
15882,"Went to California for a much needed vacation and a birthday treat for my teenage son. I have been to both Disneyland and world several times so I feel I can review with accuracy. Each time I go prices up up and the service goes down. This time employees were rude especially staff at It's a Small World, bathrooms dirty out of toilet paper and towels, stores had shirts displayed but none available and my favorite a group smoking marijuana in the park smoking section. I actually told an employee about it and he said they were aware. I waited to see what happened NOTHING!! Lots of intoxicated guests as well from wine fest. Three different rides broke down while I wasn't in line and they cleared out the lines. The topper was the fireworks being cancelled on the only night I could see them. Not the family experience I remember just a couple of years ago there. Long lines as always and fast passes gone for day buy 11 is always a great plus. Overall I have to say the Disney name no longer the quality I expected. This maybe my last visit. Two days almost two thousand dollars and got on 16 rides. I was there both days for almost the whole day.",0

Disneyland is a great place to visit but i would recommend downtown disney more if your going to visit during christmas",0
29852,The park is nice so as everything inside it but there are a lot of queues so you need to wait a long time to do everything,0
15879,Our first thought when we entered Main Street and saw the castle was they have shrunk Florida Disney   instead of Cinderella's castle it is Cinderella's bungalow!Yes everything is smaller than Florida but there are definitely some good points. Space Mountain is Star Wars themed and Star Tours has been updated following the release of the latest Star Wars film   these were definitely the main highlights. Buzz Lightyear's ride was great fun and it was good that the guns weren't fixed   our scores were definitely higher here than at Florida.The good thing about here is that they run the old style fast pass that you cannot book months in advance so everyone has a fair chance on getting one.Its a Small World (the ride I dislike the most) was actually better here than at Florida because they incorporate some of your favourite characters even if the quality was not as good as Florida the imagination was better.Big Thunder Mountain was not that big but still good fun.The downside for me was that most of the queues were outside with very little shade so make sure you put on loads of sunscreen and grab a hat.A fun park on a smaller scale than Florida so ideal for younger guests.,0
9039,"HK Disneyland has a typical disneyland layout and quality standards, but is missing (1) Pirates of the Carribean, (2) Thunder Mountain, (3) Haunted House, (4) Bear Singing Review, (5) Tiki Birds Singing, (6) Star Wars Tours, and (7) Peter Pan. Furthermore, Small World was closed for renovation. They substituted live shows such as Lion King, Mickey Review and a 3 D film    essentially replacing machinery with low cost Chinese labor. There is also a strange Toy Story area. For a small child's first Disney experience, it is okay; for anyone else it is unsatisfying. ",0
36788,Came on a Friday at the end of February. Was looking forward to an empty park. Didn't work. Massive queues everywhere (some up to a full hour). Short rides (less than two minutes for many). Fastpasses were finished by 13:30. To be fair   my six year old daughter said she had a good day. But she had a better time the next day in Luxemburg gardens and the Rodin museum. If you still want to go   get the tickets in advance online. Plan your visit with all the information on the website. Utilize the fastpass system   it's free and saves a lot of time. Come with a lot of patience and think of things to do while you stand in line for hours on end. ,0
29926,"I guess my expectations were too high. The park is exactly the same thing as an amusement park we have in my home country, even where the attractions are located. Attractions close from time to time without notice   I think it is a way the park has to make people walk around and go to not so popular attractions. The mobile app is a good tool to plan where you are going next. Don't think you will see Mickey related things everywhere, because that is not the reality; actually, we spent 15 hours there and we did not see Mickey.",0
36603,"Just vistited Disneyland Paris this Easter weekend with our 2 children aged 2 (just) and 9. All in all it was an OK experience but we (the children mainly) were extremely disappointed at the absence of the characters. We were there for a total of 11 hours and saw Mickey, Minnie, Donald & Daisy on a parade float once! Even at that we were kept about 5 metres away from them. When we booked the trip and told the children they were really excited, mainly to be  meeting  the stars of Disney. There were NONE around the park! No hand shaking, photos etc as you are led to believe from their literature before your visit. Above all we had told the children that they would see them and they were looking forward to this so much. Our 2 year old kept smiling and pointing at photos of Mickey & Minnie with such excitement and were really let down not to have had this precious, promised meeting which in turn made us out to have filled them with false promises. We expected several characters in each zone to enhance the Disney experience and overall this was a total let down. We feel that Disneyland didn't fulfil their promises that they advertised. Our children saw more of Mickey on the Metro ads and around the city than they did in the park.",0

36599,"2nd visit, I think it has improved since 7 years ago but i was surprised by how many rides broke or were being refurbished while there. Stayed at Santa Fe, awful, but gave you 2 hours entrance before general public however only gave access to 1 2 park at Disneyland & the studios entrance was normal time so not much of a deal. Food expensive and eateries tatty unless going in restaurants. Paid for meal deals  plus  had to book in advance to get in anywhere, food nice though. The deal gave you a snack between 3 6 too. Shows good but queues for characters ridiculous as expected but more frequency would alleviate this. Ate at Cafe Mickey to get chance to see characters. Lots of walking but you can hire prams trolley. Queues an hour for each ride & fast pass tickets only available on about 6 rides, you can't get another pass till the one you have has expired & they are all given out by lunch...some great rides, for all family teens & little ones. Lessons need to be learnt from Florida & do your maintenance in the winter not Easter break!",0

36601,"I am writing this review waiting in line to attraction (60minutes). Disney park is amazing, beautiful paradise of our childhood's dreams. We were inspired by this park 10years ago, when came here first time and had seen all park's attraction in 1 day. This time we were proud to open this paradise for our little kids, who were dreaming about it. But this   time the paradise was lost, our kids said, they do not want to come here again. I believe that Paradise was lost by it's formal management. In order to see all attractions here, one have to spend average 70% of time in waiting to get to attractions. Fast pass: it does not work any more like 10 years ago, fast pass's slots were turned off at 1pm, and to get to all famous attractions you had to wait about 60 minutes on each. Unfortunately we had short vacation and do not have time to spend in Disney land park 3 days(10years ago we managed to explore 100% of attractions in 1 day). I mentioned management,   of course this is the reason of our unsuccessful vacation. I tried to speak with some staff asking advise how to get solution, because we do not have enough time to complete our tour, but received just formal replied like  it is policy for all  . It looks like they care more to be right than to care customers satisfaction. Daughter of our friends asked in the shop the price of some merchandise(she forgot eyeglasses in hotel), but received nervous reply  You have to look the tag! (Seller did not care that it was to dark in pirates shop, and the girl should have problem with her eyes). Conclusion : 1. the park is fantastic , 2. Disney brand is very popular, so it looks like no necessary to improve   management and service which are pour, 3. Need to plan 3 days to stay here to avoid disappointments like we. And be ready to spend to much money for overpriced merchandise; our 7 year old son just studied in primary school topic about  fair trade   he told us that  toys are sold with unfair prices here .   I do not like to write unpleasant reviews, you can see that I had wrote over 200 excellent or good reviews. But this time I feel responsibility to point public attention to this topic, because it concerns childhood. I believe, that it is important to hold the balance between commercial interests and children's happiness. Ps: I asked in reception of hotel if there any option for people who does not have time for multi day visit to pay extra for guaranteed fast pass (like in other brand parks), I received very polite and smily negative and formal reply  ",0
15704,My aunt and I met my sister at the grand hotel. We had 4 hours of free parking IF we ate at one of two restaurants. We went to the lounge were we drank and ate and visited for 6 hours. Our bill was $ 314.00. Our parking was $70. No free parking if you don't go where they want you to go or stay longer. Ridiculous.,0
36604,"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris having been in 2010 and 2011. I remember on our first visit in 2010 I couldn't believe how pristine it was but cannot say the same this year   unfortunately it has lost its sparkle and has become very grubby (people urinating in the caves doesn't help and it is very disappointing as one thing the park has is plenty of toilets). There used to be characters galore walking about the parks, the excitement of not knowing who you would but in to has vanished as now you have to queue to see them   and I really felt for the tiny Spiderman fan whose mum wouldn't queue for the hour! Management need re think the queuing system for rides   there should be a fast lane for children under 12. Standing in a line for 50 to 70 minutes with groups of teenagers adults in front is quite disheartening. The  fast pass  is laughable to say the least! Everyone should experience Disney but these rides are aimed at children and there should be some sort of restriction in place to let children enjoy the experience.Quite a few rides closed but the best ride was ratatouille and the new buzz light year area is great. Armageddon is a waste of time but having not done it the previous 2 visits we had to give it a go. Disney need to promote 'baby swap' as a couple behind us with a baby hadn't heard of it and it was their last day. One parent queues with older child(ren) whilst the other goes to the exit of the ride with the baby. When the parent that queues finishes the ride the other parent gets on straight away. When my son was a baby it got our daughter double rides as she was able to get on again with the second parent. We stayed in Sequoia Lodge this visit, having previously thought the Disney Hotel was a waste of money. I would love to know who gives these hotels their ratings as they are both barely 3 star, the only advantage is the location of the Disney Hotel. Security would be an issue also as on this visit to Sequoia the lady in front who had just checked in had been given key cards to a room that was still occupied   this happened to us in the Disney Hotel!Overall experience was disappointing for the money spent!",0
36613,"Easter Sunday we took our daughter to Paris Disneyland for her tenth birthday. Started our experience in a dirty cafe with hardly any seating and a awful coffee , muffin and hot chocolate so hot my daughter burn't her mouth. First ride was closed, second ride closed! Pocahontas playground was lame. Next stop  orbitron 1hour wait for a ride that took under two minutes. Took ten minutes to buy two packs of crisps when there was only two people ahead of me. The food being served looked so plastic, all we wanted were some sandwiches. We left starving! Everywhere we went rides were closed , including space mountain. The rides that were open had waiting times of over an hour and many with no  fast pass . WE DESCRIBE IT AS A Very very expensive THEME MALL as the only places that were easy to access were the many shops selling endless Disney products, even then the service was painfully slow. Congratulations to all the wonderful, patient, tolerant , well mannered good humoured parents from all over the world that were at Disneyland Paris Easter Day!",0
13950,"I'm currently standing in an hour and a half long line just to get on Finding Nemo. If your favorite ride is Space Mountain, expect a two and a half hour wait. The amount of people that are allowed into the park is ridiculous. We have to follow lines to get from land to land. I use to come here every year up through high school, never have I experienced so many people at Disneyland. Eventhough this is  peak season,  I wish those who operate the park would care about the happiness of the visitors who pay over $100 a ticket versus their net profit. Disney, everyone standing in these lines and herding through the park look miserable. Please take this post to heart.",0
36606,"Ok, lets start off by saying the kids(7 and 4) loved it. Thats the end of the good news. The park itself seen thru an adults eyes is a sorry looking affair. The price of everything which is well documented on here is extortionate and is only half the story. To eat you may need to go to a loan company first but then you are lucky to then EVEN get to eat. The restaurants are few and can't handle even a half full park. The first day after traipsing round with the kids and looking forward to somewhere to eat and sit down was an eye opener as you can't get a table unless you reserved it in advance which is ludicrous.When we visited over Easter, Space Mountain was closed, so was the Haunted Mansion, the Runaway Mine train had a fault(which was fixed by lunchtime(which is just to give you a timeline as we never actually got to eat)) and the Buzz Lightyear ride broke down as we were halfway round... I like the French but they revert to type on the ride changeovers. They are so slow at getting people off an attraction and new people on that it adds an eon to the queue time. Some of the rides are no better than local fairground rides..(step forward Snow White and Pinnochio)The shows are OK but are so dangerous as you get herded into these waiting areas before the doors are opened and people are jostling for the front that myself and my wife were keeping a firm grip on our girlsYou know that it is going to be a stamina slog with all the walking but you don't expect a law of the jungle attitude as people push, pull and are rude..Overall, it will be our one and only visit and if you are thinking of going, stick with Thorpe Park, Alton Towers, Blackpool Pleasure beach or one of the other theme parks. If you definitely want Disney, save up and do Florida.. Disneyland Paris just wants me to get the rat poison out for Mickey...",0
36608,"Two of us went to the Paris disneyland park over the Easter weekend and had a really disappointing time. Despite focussing on getting on as many rides as possible (we even ate lunch in a queue) we only managed four rides in a full day (three if you don't count the haunted house)! We queued for an hour for Indiana Jones before being kicked off because the ride had broken down, Space Mountain was closed, and we were turned away from Pirates and Thunder Mountain (the first time we tried) because they had temporarily broken down as well!Although the parades were kind of fun, there were no characters walking around, the rides weren't particularly well themed (e.g. the thunder mountain and the haunted house didn't even have disney themes), and so I don't see what Disneyland has over parks that actually have good rides.",0
36609,"Just returned back from 4 days Eurodisney trip during April 6, 2015 Easter brake.I must admit it was a complete disappointment from my perspective as an adult. It was ok from my son's perspective as he is only 3.5 years old and did not expect anything more than he was provided. He would have double triple better experience and more fun if we did not experience below issues. In a nutshell:  Does not work when you spend 45 minutes on the average for one minute ride! Queues' estimated waiting time were between 20 120 minutes!  Total disappointment when fast track provides you 3.15 pm slot when you go to fast track ticket machine at 10.30 am. Also did not understand why request to stop by fast track machine when  fast track concept  is offered. The worst is still need to wait 20 minutes in fast track line when you do all of these!  Here comes the experience that made me say  never ever! . 45 minutes estimated waiting time label as opposed to 130 minutes queue time. Not finished! Train stopped for 15 minutes during the ride just because of 5.30pm show and this was mentioned just 10 minutes before we got on the train (120 minutes after started to wait in the queue!).Restaurants;  Bistrot Chez Remy: Good food and good service. Strongly recommended.  Walt: Very good food and good service. Strongly recommended.  Auberge de Cendrillon: Poor food but good service. Characters were very friendly and spent a lot of time with kids. Strongly recommended.  Mickey's cafe: Poor service and poor food. Not recommended. Characters were ok.Conclusion: There are material management issues in Eurodisney. The idea is great, premises are ok, but lack of proper management and poor customer service are the names of the game! Sorry for being so open. Eurodisney strongly NOT recommended. Try the others even thousands miles away!",0
4147,"I've been to this place in 2006 with nephews and nieces, this year with relatives again including 2 kids, 6 and 8. The kids enjoyed, as kids are wont to if there are rides, but there is nothing really new here except that the parade has changed. Except for one, in my opinion, all other food establishments are so so and expensive.",0
36611,A fabulous time in both parks. The prices are extortionate. We bought the plus dinner package which is 36.99 unless you want an la carte and then it is only worth 34. Didn't know the exchange rate was that bad! Two star food for five star price! I came in 20000 and it was an amazing experience. This time the attractions were brilliant just forget the food.,0
12357,"I think I was way to exitced to come to Disneyland. I held my expectations way to high. This was my very first visit to Disneyland, and I was super exitced! I had been to the Disney World resort in Florida and totally loved it! However, Disneyland wasn't the same. I was honestly not happy with my visit. There were a lot of rides closed the day I visited, (mid March 2017). This caused a lot of the other rides to be very busy. I didn't even ride 10 rides. I only recall riding Splash Mountain, Haunted Mansion, It's a Small World, Big Mountain Thunder Railroad, The Finding Nemo Ride, Dumbo, and Space Mountain. We also rode a couple of slow rides in the back near the castle. I really would suggest getting a fast pass to Space Mountain. My cousin and I waited in the line for an hour and four minutes. Once we were finished with the ride the wait was nearly three hours. The wait would have been better if we were not waiting in the hot sun. I would also say the the Haunted Mansion ride isn't very good. They say it's a roller coaster but in reality it's not. It has one small drop but compared to Big Mountain Thunder Railroad it was nothing. Speaking of Big Mountain Thunder Railroad that ride was shut down for more than half of the day. It didn't re open until close to 8 o'clock. As for the other rides, I really liked Splash Mountain. It was a nice little ride and we didn't get very wet. I would suggest getting a fast pass for this one, espically if you are planning to go on it in the late afternoon. My Mom and I did the finding Nemo ride and it was pretty cool. You go underwater in a sub marine and it's quite the lengthy ride so it passes time if your waiting for something else. The food overall was very good! We all got salads for lunch and it was probally the best salad I had ever eaten. It was fresh and was nice and cold too. It also came with a good sauce as well. However, I was disapointed with Dinseyland due to so many rides being closed and shut down. I wanted to go on the Pirates of the Caribban ride since I had never been on it before, but it was closed. ",0
36595,"Just spent oneday at both parks. In Disney losts of the attractions were closed, yet got hammered for full price. I went 20 years ago when it opened and wanted to take my son Stood in line for over an hour to buy tickets and watch only one wicket be opened until 10:45. Apparently the French do not share the customer experience that happened in the US parks. I wouldst suggest that you save your money and fly to Orlando. Closed   space mountain, star tours, captain Nemo's sub, phantom manor , thunder Mesa riverboats landing. Way too much to be closed for full price. Heck even the bathrooms were closed and the other one didn't have a dryer that worked in the men's bathroom. I wish I read these reviews before I wasted my time and money!!!! Don't go!!!!!!!",0
22054,"Now that I have been to both parks. This is what I think. Disneyland is a lot smaller in size. This creates a bottleneck along the walkways when crowded, The lines are longer and don't move as often. This is due to lack of space to put lines in place. They do not have ticket kiosks. The day I was there most people were renewing their season pass, Took 1 1 2 hour in line to buy a three day pass (not a good start). Also not very good in getting people thru the gate and into the park. another 1 2 hour. Most of the stores are the same. The rides are slightly different. You want to make sure you check to see what rides are down before you purchase your ticket. This will help you to be not disappointed after you entered the park. I also learned that most visitors have passes. Millions of people within 35 miles. Some only visit for a few hours but most all day on the Sunday (I was told passes can't be used on Saturday). Went twice during my visit had a good time, ate well, rode all of the rides. Would I go back to Disneyland? No. I choose Disneyworld. I understand the space constraint issue they have. But most of there problems would be solved with updated ticketing kiosks and better planning on how to move people quicker. One last item. We rode splash mountain that listed a 50 minute wait. After 2 hours we finally rode the ride.",0
36593,"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris and we were extremely disappointed. There was a lack of characters around the park and were only a few meet and greets which resulted in long queues. Waited 2.5 hours to see a princess. There were also a lot of attractions that were closed and ones that were open were breaking down regularly for example crushers coaster. Due to this, all the other attractions had much longer waiting queues. There was also no parade at Universal Studios and only meet and greets were Mickey and buzz which I thought was extremely poor! Also Discoveryland was extremely poor due to the closures! We also went for breakfast in plaza gardens and there was no cutlery, cups or plates available to have our breakfast!! We wont be going back here!!",0
36592,"Ticket wise, go for an annual passport ticket, not much difference in price but plenty of benefits.If you have Extra Magic Hours, use them to their fullest, last week most of the open rides were walk on until about 9am and only a 5 min wait between then and park opening at 10am.Not as many staff and not as friendly as in Florida. Not much control around queues, mainly around European cultural differences (plenty of pushing an shoving going on). This is also present with effect to smoking which is allowed in all open air areas and not enforced in the covered ride queues.Security are also disinterested in tackling the various street traders and distraction pick pockets that loiter between the park gates and the car park. When I reported the encounters we had to guest services, they were also not interested and just shrugged shoulders. Not what I expect really.As others have said, many rides are closed for refurb, and this will only get worse as the 25th Anniversary approaches. The paint work generally around the park is quite tired and peeling.Character meet and greets can chew vast amounts of time up (eg Rapunzel   2 3 4 hours), so we avoided them all. Princess Pavilion is also a random princess, you don't get to choose or know who it may be in advance and also effectively have to queue twice. Until they sort this out, my advice would be to avoid it.Watch out for the changing weather and dress accordingly, the wind can be quite strong especially at night while waiting for the Dreams show. Also food and drinks are available. They are expensive but no more so than any other theme park with a captive customer base. McDonald's is a short walk away in Disney Village, although our experience was that this was busy and not that cheap compared with the UK.Would I go back .... Yes, would I be more aware of the short comings .... definitely.",0
36590,"Pros: looks like a Disney park and has many of the same features and elements. For English speakers, all signs and verbal notices are in English and French. All park employees I spoke to spoke decent to excellent English. In addition, we were there for Easter weekend. Security was tight. Bags were xrayed, there were mounted police and security dogs outside the park. There were 2 helicopters and 1 plane circling the park. Not sure if they were security but they were there all day so I don't think it was coincidence. We felt very secure and safe. Can't promise that's the level of security all the time but they take security serious.Cons: It just doesn't reach the high excellence bar set by the US parks. The employees (except for one of the train station Engineers) were a little lack luster. Didn't seem excited to be working at a Disney park or show any enthusiasm. The train cast member was so excited to meet us, greeted everyone in line and said he gets to go work at Disney World, which he so deserves. But the reason he stood out was because he was the only cast member who exhibited the usual friendliness found in a US park. The bathrooms are the WORST that I experienced after touring around France and Paris for 2 weeks. They reeked and were disgustingly filthy. No tp, no soap, used tp piled up everywhere (I understand the  cultural  aspect of not flushing but they can't even provide a receptacle in each stall? ). And it's the worst food of all the Disney parks I've been to countless times in the last 20 years. It was expensive and for being in France, the food capital of the world, it was way worse than the food at the US parks. I think the food in the US parks is really good and of decent quality but this was subpar and mediocre at best. Overall: If you have time, go. I wouldn't make a special trip for it. If you're used to US Disney parks, lower your expectations and you'll be happier.",0
30005,"Disneyland Paris, is not Disneyland in Europe, more a cheaper, smaller replica charging heavy prices. If you've never been to Florida it may give the impression of Disney but if you have been to Florida it's disappointing. Frequent technical issues meant popular rides were closed or had ridiculous queue lengths. Considering it was height of summer holidays there were numerous ride closures for refurbishment. Not all the rides are open during the 'extra hours' for those staying at Disney Hotels. Food here is VERY EXPENSIVE   you are a captive audience and the Park charges accordingly. Burger and chips cost    15. Book your meals if possible as the queues to eat are long and the better restaurants are very booked weeks in advance. We visited several years ago (2012) and it felt like the Park hadn't improved any. The update of Star Wars was only marginal given the Space Mountain still had the original decorations which didn't lend to its supposed reinvention to Star Wars. Overall we found Disneyland Paris a disappointment and would be unlikely to return. ",0
36588,"Visited here today. perfect weather, should have been magical. The only magical part was the parade, and one or two of the rides. 4 of the more adventurous ride were either broken down or being renovated, 2 of the smaller children rides were also not working. Just a suggestion why not renovate in say November, January or February NOT Easter break weeks. NO mention of any refunds of ticket prices, for the disappointment of these rides not being availableThere is no notice that the Princess Pavilion has to be booked in advance, would be a good idea to say so on web site. It seems lots of events are aimed at people who stay on the park with comments from members of the cast  its full today come back tomorrow  not at those prices. In fact we will never go again, the food was appalling ,overpriced, and the service was very slow. There were very few characters walking around the the site only saw one the whole day.The only thing well run was the parade. Carry on in this vein Disney and the site will soon close. WHAT A SHAME!!",0
22057,"Our first trip to Disneyland was ruined by the massive crowds and number of closed attractions. While the California Adventure park was not nearly as crowded as Disneyland, there were still one  to two hour waits for most rides and attractions, and the FastPass availability was either for very late in the day or nonexistent. Disneyland was so crowded, it was impossible to walk in the park, and waits for rides and attractions were two to three hours. So many rides and attractions were closed, as well, including many of the most popular ones. Food prices were actually not too terrible, and the food itself was good to very good. In particular, we enjoyed the Sonoma Terrace, which had some good wines and a wonderful terrace on which to enjoy them. However, we will never return, as the price of admission was a poor value for what we were able to do.",0
25946,I am a Disney aficionado. I have been going there for decades. I go once or twice a year I was shocked at our recent visit to find a one day park hopper for myself and daughter cost almost $250. Seriously?! This is before you buy any of the overpriced food and souvenirs. How can families afford this?,0
33110,"I went to Disneyland Paris a while ago and having been to Disneyworld Orlando it's difficult not to make comparisons.Disneyland Paris can still be a magical holiday in its own right providing this is the only Disney you've experienced. Disneyworld Orlando has 6 or 7 parks, Paris only has the 2. I would recommend Disneyland Paris to people who want to experience Disney, but have a smaller budget, or perhaps want a shorter flight break, and have not visited Disneyworld. Otherwise I'd suggest saving up and visiting Florida instead : )",0
36584,"We were big fans of Disney Parks. We visited Disney World in Florida a number of times and had a very positive experience, despite very large crowds, because crowds were well managed. But this past trip was not very kid friendly. Disney Park in Paris is not good for small kids (ours 7 and 4), or anyone else who does not want to stand in endless lines. When we were there in the middle of a cold and rainy week in April, there were lines with 60 minutes wait almost for every ride in both parks and no fast passes were offered. Fast pass machines were available only in the morning and then were quickly shut off. The park was full of people until the very closing time, so do not think you can wait it out and get on a ride when others leave for home, it never happened to us. We tried to get to see a show at Animagic because the line was smaller; we waited 30 minutes and then we were let in to the theater but then show did not start until 15 minutes later so my son who is four years could not wait for the bathroom. I asked if there was any bathroom in the building   it would be pity to miss a show after waiting 45 minutes   but the answer was no so we had to run to the bathroom outside. When we came back and tried to get back in again a man whose name was Lytisse said we could not get back in because the show already started. In fact, the show did not start for another 5 minutes, and my husband was saving our seats, but we were not allowed to get to them. We paid more than 500 Euros for two days for a family of four for this. It was an expensive and very frustrating trip. Not worth it, and not worthy of the Disney name.",0
22060,"Visited 21 5 2014. This park is a joke, three main rides were closed in one park and one in the other and two broken which means the huge crowds made for 2 hour wait times. At $150 for a one day hopper this turned out to be an expensive crowded walk. Google Disneyland to see what a shameful joke this place is, oh...$17 to park a car. I have been to Disney Florida for 29 years so I am not naive about wait times, this park is a disgrace.",0
15697,"We visited the park on April 23 which is supposed to be a moderate weekend for crowds. We arrived at 8 am, fortunately, which allowed us to ride about six rides by 10 am. After that, it was so crowded we could barely move. We held our six year old granddaughter's hand the entire time so she would not get lost or trampled by the crowds. Many lines past noon had 90 minute waits. We planned our day carefully and used the Fast Pass options which helped, but it was less than the Happiest Place on Earth for us. We saw a few characters during the day...Pluto, Mary Poppins and Bert...where were the rest? We logged our walking during the day and walked 10.7 miles by 5 pm, when we were too exhausted to walk any further. Fortunately our six year old was a trooper and enjoyed her day. We couldn't bear the thought of the crowds for the evening events and went back to our hotel to swim in the relaxing pool...",0
22062,"We went in early May with a large group. This is the  big trip  they take every year. Usually they go in June, but to beat the out of school crowds we went in May. There were 8 rides closed!! Most of them were the ones our group loves (Pirates, Nemo, Jungle Cruise). Small World was closed and looked like it had been for quite some time (leaves in the canal, no water). When we came last year it was also closed.The new system they have in place to serve the disabled is pretty good, but maybe letting people have more than one ride  on reserve  would be better. We spent more time trying to find the accessible kiosks than we did on rides.Kudos to the Cast members though, when one of our group got misplaced they flew into action and had eyes on him within 15 minutes :)",0
8986,The merchandise in this Disneyland was catered more toward an Asian market... with only a select few characters promoting the place (mainly Minnie and Winnie the Pooh). There are lots of cute stationary on offer compared to plush and other toys. I had a great time here though. The lines weren't long (which meant we were over and done with in a few hours) and it was nice to get a thrill in the Toy Story land. ,0
22064,"I have no doubt that Disneyland was going off, circa 1982. But it has not kept pace with the times and it is just sad, dingy, shabby and rundown. And a total waste of money.I had a few laughs, but at one point the big rides (the ones for adults) ALL shut down except for space mountain with no indication when they'd reopen, plus a bunch like pirates of the Caribbean and finding nemo were closed all day. It was quite bizarre.What they need is wifi access, more signage in general, electronic signage letting you know what is open, ride wait times etc   all the things that people these days expect.But more importantly it was just the overall dinginess that was the biggest disappointment  happiest place on earth and magical is just a marketing ploy   an excellent one they do brilliantly. The reality is just old, dated rides that looked shabby and 80s. Even the staff in their awful uniforms looked like someone from the 80s trying to look 50s.Unless you have young kids, and I mean age ten tops, don't bother. It is just sad and overrated. Totally shocked at the good reviews this place gets. I think it just is one of those childhood fantasy places we all build up in our minds, and the reality is just awful.Save your money and go elsewhere!",0
36612,"Can i just say first of all that my boys aged 11 and 8 enjoyed it immensely and obviously didn't see what us adults saw, but I have to say it's very tired especially around the space mountain area which we were bitterly disappointed was closed for refurb, as was many other rides which to be honest if we had known we would have changed dates as there were quite a few!! The 2 hours opening early for hotel guests was really a waste of time because all the good rides were not open anyway? We came several years ago and there seemed a lot more characters walking around sadly there were none only ones you had to queue for If the Walt Disney studios were not there I would have been very disappointed in the park, having said that we had a great time the fireworks at 9.30 were brilliant! And because we went full board we didn't need to queue for food",0
36614,"I was here during the Easter holiday weekend so expected it to be crowded and swarming with people. This park is disappointing to say the least. The queue was very long, an average wait time of 1 hour for the more popular rides.Maintenance and servicing of the rides are not the highest priority of the management because after waiting more than 1 hr for the Indiana Jones ride, they had technical issues and promptly closed it down. After waiting another 30 mins, I decided to leave, most of the guests did the same.The attractions are dated and not very interesting.Save your money and go to Orlando instead, this place can't hold a candle to the Florida mothership.",0
24130,"After spending over 4K to visit Disneyland, we are so disappointed we went. Numerous rides broken down and  or closed while on the ride, waiting for the ride, or in line for ride. Shuttles were too full to board and never on time, Ariel's Grotto was a hurry up and eat, blink and you miss seeing the princesses ($200 for our family of 5 to eat there). Very impersonal. Parade float broke down before Mickey's parade so it was 30 min late. During that same parade ANOTHER parade float broke down. After listening to Princess Tiana sing the same two songs four times, our daughters asked to leave the parade.Super shuttle went to wrong hotel to pick us up to take us to airport. Almost missed our plane ride home.Very disappointed. Will not go back.",0
22036,"At nearly $100 per day for entrance, most attractions are included, however food is not and at $8  for a corn dog, that is not something to take lightly for a family! Plan on spending close to $100 per day additionally per person, just on food. Souvenirs are not cheap either. Plan on $26 for T shirts, $56 for jackets or sweaters, $20 $50 for Micky Ear hats, and $5  for little trinkets! Downtown Disney has great shopping, but prices are pretty similar. Free Disney apps help with things like dining, maps & wait times. Must try's are the Dole Whip at the Tiki Room, Bengal BBQ for a relatively inexpensive quick meal, Turkey Legs ($10) located throughout both parks now), the Monte Carlo at Blue Bayou and Goofy's Kitchen (worth the price, I promise!). ",0
31496,"It is safe to say we did not enjoy our visit. There was a 40 minute queue to get in the car park and then a 50 minute queue to get through security. They were the shortest queues of the day. My son is a huge Star Wars fan which is primarily why we visited, so we headed straight for that area. We queued for the Jedi training to start. There was no explanation of what this was so we assumed it was a ride. No staff there or signs to tell us any different. 90 minutes later we got into the building only to be told unhelpfully to come back at 5.00 and then my son MUST agree to go on stage or he couldn't go in (at which point he was terrified of fighting Darth and fed up). We were livid: we'd spent the entire morning in queues and not even been on a ride (or seen anything Star Wars related). The day got worse when someone had let their child poo, yes poo, on a bench which my son then sat on. We cleaned it up after a 20m queue for the toilet. On the plus side, they were clean. Luckily we bought sandwiches so no queue for lunch . We managed 3 rides in the afternoon. We used the Fastpass so only queued for 20m on the Buzz and Star Wars Simulator rides. These were both great fun and well done. Definitely do Fast Pass although be aware you can only get one at a time so only used 2 all day. The Star Wars parade and the evening parade were enjoyed by the kids (although we could only see the top of the floats due to crowds). If you're only there for one day at a busy time, don't bother with both parks as you won't have time. We wasted money on that. Would've liked to see more characters wandering around and maybe entertaining people in the queues. Disneyland is basically a glorified theme park which is overpriced and too many are allowed in. They need to limit tickets for people to enjoy it. Save your money and go to Thorpe Park or Legoland instead unless you are a die hard Disney fan or love queuing.  ",0
36634,"The first thing you should remember about going to Disney in Europe is that you are spending the day with Europeans and not Americans. Therefore, leave your American culture at the gate and remember that Disney is for the kids and not you. That being said, we visited in April on a mostly rainy day so we got on almost all the rides we had planned to go to and also spent time in the other park too. We did have a ride break on us and the attendants were very helpful and gave us a ticket to come back when it was fixed without waiting in line (we didn't use it because we were near the end of the ride anyway). We ate lunch at the Hakuna Matata restaurant and had a decent lunch for expected Disney prices.Drawbacks: 1) Walking up to a character session and being told  time is done  without an explanation that the character needed to go to a parade. 2) Some of the rides were in need of repairs and touch ups. The Star Wars ride in particular had a few lights and a couple chairs out of order.Positives:1) The Disney Paris Express shuttle service which you can purchase with your tickets at the official Disney site was perfect for us as we were staying in Paris. They give good addresses for the four pick up locations and we were able to enjoy 10 hours of Disney time and have the coach return us to Paris at the end of the day. 2) It is a bit different and felt smaller than the Disney parks in Anaheim and Orlando. Smaller wasn't the positive, but while there were many similar rides, there were also different rides which gives Disneyland Paris it's own vibe.For our one day trip to the two parks, we were pretty happy with the experience. That being said, please note that the Walt Disney Studio Park closes at 6pm compared to Disneyland Paris. We missed a couple rides because we didn't realize it closed earlier.",0
4136,"I arrived in time for the afternoon parade, there were no queue lines so getting there was breezy. Seeing those disney characters alive was such a joy. After the parade, i was able to take a photo with goofy and pluto, but failed to see Mickey and minnie for it was already 6 in the evening and the queuing lines were closed, such a disappointment. i roamed around only to see that most of the attractions were already closed by 7pm. So i went back to the center only to find out that the evening parade had already started. There were too many people lined along the streets so it was hard to see the remaining of the parade. Lastly, i went in front of the castle, people were already seated and luckily i was able to find my own spot. I waited for at least 30minutes for the fireworks display and it was amazing, just wow! ",0
15713,"Outrageously expensive and outrageously crowded. My teen enjoyed his final trip to Disneyland. The characters are fun, the few activities available that are not rides were fun, but the crowd and the prices are punishing. Maybe I'm just not a Disney sort of person, but you would think at some point the experience of not even being able to walk through a crowd would be a concern for safety, if nothing else.",0
22038,"We recently visited Disneyland California a trip that we saved up for and that I spent months planning for to ensure the most magical vacation for my family. I asked numerous  cast members  if the time was a good time to go and every one of them replied with an enthusiastic  YES!  It turns out it was as crowded as the times I have visited in June and July in the past. Though the rides and shows were as magical as ever we spent three days there and weren't able to do half of what we wanted because it was so packed. The food was substandard and some of the cast members were less than friendly. It is sad because it seems that all things Disney have strayed far from the original goal of Walt Disney. It now appears to be more about the money, for an already wealthy big business, than the magic. I understand the concept of supply and demand and that if it were super cheap then it would be even more over crowded but how about limiting the number of visitors per day. One of the cast members told us that capacity for Disneyland alone was 80,000 aprox. that is insane . It was not yet at capacity, because they were not turning people away at the gates, and we could not walk down the street in a group. people were irritable and at times rude because we were trying to do what everyone else was doing which was to get through the crowds. I do not feel like we got our money's worth because of the number of things we did not get to do and the food was not what I would consider typical Disney quality it was however much more expensive than what I remember paying 3 years ago. This all makes me very sad because for me Disney has always been magical. I enthusiastically counted down the days to our trip with the kids only to be so let down. I hate to say that Disney has really lost the magic for me. The curtain was pulled back and the true motive of Disney revealed. If you want to have a fun family vacation in today's economy find some place that needs your money rather than generating more wealth for the wealthy and merely being pushed through like cattle.",0
8997,"Magical place to go. The train station going to Disneyland is already Disney themed, with pictures and statues of Disney characters inside the train and Mickey Mouse themed handles and windows. There are lots of things to do inside Disneyland; the parade and fireworks are a must see! Foods are expensive    more than 50 HKD. Children will definitely have a good time here. Adults will enjoy some of the rides. We only enjoyed 4 rides in the place.",0
29993,"Went there with 2 kids in August 2018. While the overall ticket price is more affordable than the US counterparts, it verged on the disappointment for both adults and the kids. The Disney Studios is a bit more interesting (we had 1 days 23 parks tickets), and the wait times were not terrible, but there was nothing to really take the kids' breath away expect for the Ratatouille one. The water and everything else is overpriced, but it was to be expected. The transportation by the RER is convenient, although you have to read the website to learn that the metro Station is the only station to get there for the time being. Overall, a so so experience.",0
4146,"I know this park very well because I have been a season pass holder for two years. Of all the Disneylands I have been to this is probably the smallest of all, not quite designed for the western taste, there are very few rides, most of the attractions are just 'photo opportunities' that chinese people love and westernes and not so bothered about. On a quiet day you can ride all the rides at least once some even twice. The park is clean and the staff pleasant. All the queue areas are sheltered to protect people from the sun and rain. Some of the queue areas have ventilators that are much appreciated in thoses hot Hong Kong summer days. The restaurants terrible like all restaurants at all Disneyland resorts I've ever visited. And not cheap. You are much better off bringing your own food. The only thing worth eating are the mickey mouse waffles that they sell on the cafe at the main street, but if you buy one of those, I don't recommend that you sit on the tables at the back of the place to eat it, because it's full of very aggressive birds that steal the food and attack the children. I usually buy the waffle and eat it on one of the benches on the main street. The shops are quite cheap and the quality of the toys is very good, the t shirts are a bit so so. The only problem with the shop is that the clothes are tailored to the chinese taste so if you are a Westener you may struggle to find things that would want to wear and fit because of lack of large sizes.",0
4130,"Nice & clean park. Some good rides but could do with updating & some more 'high thrill' rides. Think I was spoilt having done Florida first. Worth a visit. Traveled via the MTR, fast & easy, totally stress free & not heaving for the return at park close as expected. ",0
8998,"visited on feb 2012 with my family. overall is a magical experience, having grown up with disney cartoons and never been to other disneyland before. however, the tourists there, almost majority from mainland china, is just plain rude and lack basic manners. they will shove their way into your line if there is a tiny space for them and never bother to say 'sorry' if they step knock you or 'excuse me' if they wanna go through.also,the waiting line for some ride is too long. maybe there is a need to limit the tourists per day?",0
6663,"The place was great ! It has lots of attractions and rides ! But the queue ing for those attractions can be a pain, especially for little children, which causes a lot of waste of time, hence, it is not enough to explore every places here !",0
36644,"Good parts of Disneyland  The show at the end was spectacular with fireworks, water jets and projections  The parade at 5.30pm was enjoyable and the floats were very good  It was pretty in the park and there were Disney characters made out of flowersBad parts of Disneyland  Long queues  The majority of food places closed between 6pm and 7pm. We struggled to get anything to eat as there were only three places open. One, was a really expensive buffet that we couldn't get into as they had a wait of 30 minutes to 1 hour. Second, was a Pizza place which seemed to only offer cheese and tomato pizza or a cheese and ham sandwich and the third place (where we did eat) Caseys was a hot dog place and the queue was 50 minutes long so not exactly fast food. The hot dog wasn't even very nice.  Some of the staff were quite rude. We were queuing at the Old Mill to get a drink and the staff member said they were closed and would only serve one woman because she had children and the rest of us got sent away.",0
9000,"Apparently, its the smallest Disneyland there is, but hey   when you are less than a meter tall and all your favourite cartoons are walking around you, who cares?!We got to see a few princesses (whose identity were lost on me but not on my little friends). They got hungry quickly so it was kinda good and cool that the maps actually listed out every single thing that was available in the park and which corner. (ie. you can get cotton candy candy floss at the left corner of Fantasyland and if you prefer waffles instead, there is a specific streetcart you can get it at such and such a place). This is important because when kids see something and they want it. They want IT and nothing else. So I'm glad it was easy to 'hunt' for the cotton candy.Because it was small I suppose it was less crowded than the one in Florida   I'm not sure, but it meant we got to sit right by the parade and dance with a few mascot characters. This drove my 5 and 2 year old friends completely out of their mind; it was like y'know, the coolest thing ever. At that age....The show in Adventureland scared them out a bit because all the other rides attractions were held outdoors and had bright colourful lights so going straight into a dimly lit auditorium with a huge lion perching and staring at you from the top was pretty scary. Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, you have to wait from 30 45 minutes in line for the rides which is a long time if you have kids. Maybe it would be better if one parent stood in line while the kids went somewhere else to run off the sugar instead...",0
36646,"Went with my h b and 2 yo son several rides we could go on as a family loved every minute, shuttle busses were fab from airport and Disney Santa Fe. Very handy after walking all day round the parks. definitely recommend it. However I fell on uneven pavement in a queue for a ride and was taken to the first aid, on the way there in a wheelchair I was almost ripped out of the wheelchair by the casember on the tram lines super embarrassing and then sent to hospital there from 10 am till 7 pm (will not complain about a couple hours in A&E again) pretty much treated as a huge inconvenience from Disney and not asked even if I was ok afterwards and have since emailed twice which have both gone with no response whatsoever, not really what I expect from Disney and has ruined the end of the holiday, lost the whole last day and wasted food vouchers. Such a shame as thoroughly enjoyed the rest of our time there.",0
36632,"Second visit in four years, but the difference is tangible. Too many rides were closed, no shows were on, arrogant staff. Things are going from bad to worse and its getting expensive.Unless they intervene to upgrade crowds will start dwindling. Will not plan to return anytime soon!",0
36631,"When you book a holiday to Disneyland it is unreasonable to expect all attractions to be operating however to find several key attractions closed during a main holiday is disappointing. On one day in the middle of our stay I counted 9 attractions between the 2 parks closed for maintainable or broken down. Rock and Roller coaster even broke with us on it! Key attractions such as Space Mountain, Phantom Manor, Dumbo, TOT and Rock and Roller coaster all broken or closed for maintenance during our stay, large sections of the park covered in plastic sheeting or shut off. 2 large restaurants in the park (Walts and Hyperion cafe) closed for the duration of our visit. The walkway between our Hotel (Santa Fe) and the Disney village was being dug up. Generally the park felt run down, unloved and the staff are just so rude. If you have the funds go to Florida   the extra travel time is wellWorth it. Disneyland Paris is simply a Blot to the Disney name. ",0
8995,BORING... too kiddy.... They need some scary grown up rides to appeal to all the family... not another  Its a small world... too cutesy..,0
36629,The magic of Disney is not there  staff don't know what is happening and are not friendly. Children are pushed out of the way and the characters don't walk round anymore but stand somewhere and the queues are awful for young children to see the characters. We took our Grandchildren for a surprise treat and no one made them feel special as you would expect from this resort. ,0

22042,"Vacationed from Missouri to Southern CA, where I grew up. It was my kids' second visit to the park. SOOOOO disappointed!!! Even though we love Disneyland, almost every single ride that my kids were tall enough for, was CLOSED.....at the same time!!!!! So heartbreaking. I understand Disney needs to upgrade from time to time but, oh well. We did ride 3 rides, plus the monorail and train. The characters weren't out either. Last year's visit was awesome but this year's was a total miss. Guess we'll see how next visit plays out.",0
22043,"Bat day or better known as Goth day out, Some of the visitors were downright scary.. unsavoury family with a Pitt bull on a lead in the park, 8 rides in total broke or closed for repair, One staff commented OMG its such a stressful day lol . much prefer Orlando its paradise compared to Disneyland Anaheim.",0
36625,"I've been to DLP back in 2002, and last week it was my 2nd visit. Everything has changed. Toilets are dirty, many rides were closed and the queue to rides were quite long... we're only have limited options for rides. And some of the theme park's staff were not that friendly.",0
36624,"it is a real Disneyland park with all the attractions, but unfortunately almost one third of the attractions where out of service due to renovations.... the lines to the existing attractions were too long (for off season period) and you cannot find a descent coffee shop  only Automatic machines, but the parade in the afternoon and the fireworks in the evening are wonderful and exciting",0
36623,"somewhat tiresome  place, not really worth the buck. living on what has been not really living up to what is. but works for small kids still stuck in disney concept",0
29997,This place is nowhere near anything like Disneyland in Anaheim Orange County California it's nothing like the original they have no food selection nothing to eat besides a can of Coca Cola a bottle of water some pizza or a hamburger they don't have restaurants..... We flew over from California we're really excited to see this place but it was such a let down and then the other Americans that we saw in the park spend some time talking to us and we all discussed how extremely disappointing this place is it's a complete waste of time there's nothing similar to The Magic of Disneyland in the states in Florida or in California the Disney Corporation did not work well enough with France to make this authentic~~ that is what was missing is I thought it was a very trashy version of Disneyland ....nofun no excitement,0
29998,"Very disappointing attitude. I visited the park with my wife and 3 teens last wednesday (8 8 18). Got a disabled pass of the highest degree since I am...hmmm...disabled. After four hours in the park, while exiting the Buzz lightyear ride, my left knee got slammed hard against the ride   s troley. I suffered pains in my knee which slowed us all down, and for the rest of the day I mostly sat down, and we all missed the disney studios park which we also bought tickets to. Bit there   s more.At evening time when it was really blue and swollen and aching, I went to the park   s infirmary and they treated me the best they could. I thought that disney will assume responsibility, But oh How I was wrong. When we asked the park to let us revisit the Disney studios park later this week (didn   t ask our money back, didn   t say we will sue or anything, just to come back at a later day) we were absolutely shocked to Their refusal. The reason: it took me too long to come and see the doctor (a whole 3 hours or so) after the incident. So, hey, what do you think about that?",0
12354,I am sure that it has been said before but queues of two hours for the main rides is just not acceptable. Not for the amount of money that park entrance costs for a family of five.We stayed from 8am to 10pm and still failed to get on some of the big rides. They just have to have a maximum capacity for the park.All in all really cheesed off.,0
4144,"HK Disney was built on reclaimed land (formerly Penny's Bay). When the park initially opened, the theme lands were to the bare minimum. Layout is typical Disney. The architectural design is typical and nice planting design. There are 2 hotels (economical and luxury). Plenty of parking for private cars and buses. It's connected to various parts of Hong Kong and the New Territories by a clean and efficient rail system called the MTR. Every evening they have a nice fireworks display. The Disney experience is the same worldwide. Only the park facilities differ. HK Disney has the basic theme lands. ",0
15707,"I love Disneyland, but my last experience with my twin, 8 year old nieces was not good. There were way too many people in the park and the lines were too long. We paid over $500 and only got on 3 rides during the entire day. They need to find a solution to this problem during the busy months, ",0
36617,"We visited 31 03 to 4 04 with a 3 and 4 year old. We booked the trip over a year ago and were really excited about experiencing the Disney    magic   . However, the reality fell far short for reasons that could have been avoided.On our first day, a cast member shouted so rudely and aggressively at us for several minutes (as we   d walked the wrong way due to poor signage) that our 4 year old was reduced to tears. How any adult would behave in that manner around children is beyond me. The fact it happened at Disney a supposedly child friendly resort was astounding. When I tried to calmly explain our mistake and asked where to go he continued to verbally abuse us until another cast member came, spoke to him sharply in French, and helped us. Even after our return our daughter talks about the    nasty man on the train   , so shame on you Florian, you don   t deserve to work near children.The rides we went on were good, there were queues but that is to be expected. I did notice some of the larger rides were closed which would have been disappointing if our children had been older. Other guests we spoke to who had been before also said they were surprised by the amount of closures on the park.Whilst on the subject of queues, we queued to see Rapunzel. This took nearly 3 hours which is ridiculous and to me typified all that is wrong with DLP. We had two character dining experiences which couldn   t have been more different. Caf   Mickey, very basic food and poor service. It took nearly 2 hours to get a burger, when we complained we were told that the kitchen had messed up. I am glad that we did this though as otherwise we would only have seen the characters on parade and not met them. I was expecting to see them walking around the park but that didn   t happen. They spent time to get photos autographs at each table and given the queues to do this on the Park, it makes it worthwhile. So, I would recommend it but be prepared for a long wait. We went to the Auberge de Cendrillon for our daughter   s birthday and this meal was what made our stay. The staff, notably Salve our waiter, were brilliant. They were happy, conversational, helpful and professional just what you would expect from Disney but until then we hadn   t seen. Similarly, the princesses were great, Belle made our daughter   s day by singing happy birthday, even though she leaving to get ready for the parade. Snow White   s Prince Charming was also especially good with our young girls. Expensive but well worth it, given that we   d tried and failed twice to book at the Princess Pavillion.The evening parade was really good and had the Disney    feel    and it was only place where Frozen was represented. We were really disappointed by this, given the fact that most little girls adore Anna and Elsa. DLP must be the only place in the world where there is no Frozen frenzy! With a few tweaks, out of date attractions like Alice in Wonderland could be changed to represent the interests of this generation.So, overall the test of any theme park is would you return? In honesty, I   m not sure we will.",0
36616,The characters to be seen were few and far between with those that were available being restricted to organised slots with massive queues. There seemed to be a lack of atmosphere with lots of the rides and surroundings seeming tired. Quite a few were being renovated during our stay which was slightly annoying for a busy bank holiday as this only added to the queues at the other rides. Thunder mountain (when it was working) was probably one of the best here alongside pirates and buzz lightyear. The staff were friendly and the lazer and water show at closing time was worth watching. Food was extremely expensive but it's a closed market so you have to expect this. ,0
36578,"We were visiting Paris over Easter and decided to take our 7 3 4 year old to Disney.We got 1D 1P mini tickets from FNAC. and printed our e tickets. By mistake we printed out only two tickets but had electronic copies of all three tickets. We took the RER from Paris. On arrival we noticed our mistake but could not find what to do. Couldn't find any Staff and asked at the 'Travel Agent' desk. We were told to go to the 'Visitor's Relations'. We joined the slow moving queue and eventual got to the desk. There seem to a lot of others who thought you could use an e ticket on a smartphone or tablet. But no  only paper versions could be scanned. To do this impossible mission  it must be emailed to dlp.print@disney.com. The Next problem was to get a WiFi signal. Eventually we emailed the ticket and the superviser got the printout to us   almost two hour just to get in.We didn't know that the FastTrack system was only open for a very short period   the Disney site doesn't tell you this, just that can have one FastTrack ticket at a time. For my daughter one of the best thing was when the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' ride broke down. We got a ticket to return later. Although it was a short queue   20 Minutes   the queue passed through it own wonderland! When we went back, through the exit, we got the first row. And yes   I did get wet.",0
30009,"Didn   t have much fun at the light show. I could only see portions of the upper part of the castle. Too many tall people in front.

Again, unlike in Tokyo where there is always someone you can ask to take your picture.",0
15694,"Considering the amount you pay, you spend most of the day in a line. On the day we went there were 12 rides not working and twice the rides stopped when we were in the line. I had a great southern stew at the French cafe in New Orlean sq but it is an expensive day. Also the fastpass system only allows one ride at a time so you are stuck in an area. The Disneyworld system is better for getting the most for your money",0
15673,"Don't bother for the next 12   months. They've closed down heaps of rides and 4 broke down while we were there causing huge delays to wait times. No river boat cruise, no motorway ride, no alpine, the list goes on. Apparently they are closed for the new Star Wars addition, it will want to be worth it because Disneyland is heading from where dreams are made, to nightmares for parents with disappointed kids. We went when school was in for USA. A two day single pass was cheaper than a two day pass if you go Mon   Thu. First day was a Monday, Star Wars ride first up excellent fun, use the fast pass system and while you're waiting for your allocated time line up in the standby regular lines for other rides, least that's what worked for us. The first day worked like clockwork aside from awful long wait times some of the rides were great. Avoid haunted mansion it's a waste not scary unless you consider a 40 min wait for  was that it  from a hungry teenager with sore feet to be scary enough. Prepare to be faced with ridiculously long waiting times anything from 20 to 70 mins and trust me try and talk a kid out of waiting that long when they've done their research good luck! So we waited and waited noting the only rides worth waiting for, splash mountain, Indiana jones (if it works) and Star Wars but get fast passes for them. Second day was literally the worst experience of my life at any amusement park ever. We went on a Thursday were faced with multiple breakdowns got stuck on the temple of doom ride for ages before it restarted with all lights on but no sound, so effectively just sitting in a cart on tracks bumping along with a bunch of strangers lol, we were offered a second ride straight away which we took up and was cut short again. So crappy. Then we lined up and waited for 70 mins for splash mountain which subsequently broke down just as we neared the gate to get on lol absolutely ridiculous day full of 70  wait times 4 separate ride closures and breakdowns throuout the park. Either the construction at Star Wars set off a chain reaction of breakdowns or they need to review maintenance systems urgently. Aweful day won't be in a hurry to return.",0
4201,"I spent 5 hours here and was left feeling a little dissapointed. This was my first time at any Disneyland and I had high hopes of 'magic' and thrills, but only really found these at the live shows which are exceptional and definitely not to be missed. Watching the 'Festival of the Lion King' bought a tear to my eye and 'Mickey and the Wondrous Book' was also excellent, although slightly marred by the technical glitch during the performance. These very talented performers made the entrance price seem reasonable. I also appreciated the Valet service for left luggage, and parcel delivery at the gate to save carrying parcels around with you On the down side the supposed 'world famous' Jungle River Cruise was certainly not worth queuing up for 20 minutes for, and somewhat underwhelming despite our excellent guide Eric's enthusiasm. The 'It's a Small World' ride was awful in my opinion, probably only suitable for very small children. Tarzan tree house is not worth it either sadly. Next time I will bring my children, and stay for the night parade and fireworks display where I'm sure is sprinkled with magic. Also I will purchase from the Disney store at the airport rather than queuing to buy here.",0
24112,"We got there early in the morning at 9 am and we left at 12 am at midnight. It was really crowded like judgement day. I did not like the fact to stand up for hours to watch a parade or a show. I think Disney management should consider controlling park entry and population by not allowing park population to exceed certain number on a given day, through paid reservations. Food was extremely expensive and not too many choices. I enjoyed Disney World better last time I was there 4 years back. I wont advice, but good luck.",0
36527,"Our family has been to Disneyland California many times and Disney World once... There is no comparison with Disneyland Paris though. Here the cast members are nearly impossible to find and almost always unhelpful. Smokers are everywhere and are a disgusting distraction. And lastly, the attractions were constantly not working. At some times it was a challenge to find a ride that was actually running. Our children enjoyed most of the rides but even they said they would not want to return.",0
15671,They've made it really cheap for the locals. If you're planning on coming from out of state think twice. It's really overcrowded as your paying way more than the locals to stand in line for a limited number of rides since so many are out of service.,0

Fastpass was a wait of 4 hours after you got a ticket on the few open rides and all the lame rides had long lines because half the park was closed! It was horrible, and more rides broke threw out the day! They would post 30 minute wait times and then let field trips and any overweight person on a raskel scooter cut to the front of the line making wait times 2x as long as posted! They closed half the rides and had every school in California schedule a field trip to make up for off season money losses! Mickey mouse is a thief..",0

On top of that I paid an additional $50 PER DAY (3 days!) so had to spend another $150 just to get around the park. I felt that was unfair.

22088,"If you've never been to Walt Disney World, Disneyland is probably just fine. If you've been to WDW, DIsneyland will be a serious disappointment. Small, lots of closed attractions. Very different feel. A lot less tourist like (unlike WDW), and more for locals. Just really lacked that  Plus it  feeling that WDW has. They scheduled several rights to be closed, and any given day 2 3 big name rides will have issues. Not much to do. Also, nowhere to go to escape the heat. The lines are outside, often uncovered. Very little AC is being used anywhere. The stores, rides, lines, etc, all very warm. Most of the dining locations are outside as well.Just really lacking. Yes it has Cars land. Thunder Mtn has improved. But, not enough. It's more like a Six Flags. Roaming groups of unsupervised kids, people cutting through lines, etc.",0
33117,"The park itself was quite disappointing, so many things empty or not working. Staff a little unfriendly in places but it just about passed with the kids. I dont think they'd enjoy it in another year if whole parts of the park are not in operation. We were going throught the map with them and it seemed every other ride was like oh no kids sorry, that ones closed too.We also had the disability pass which on the most part made our trip brilliant but there was definitely a serious lack of flexibility in its usage. We all wanted to go and see the Star Wars Jedi training but our autistic son was asleep in the wheelchair. The WHOLE section was empty but because she said if you can walk you cant take the chair, she wouldnt let us take him in. I tried repeating that he was asleep and couldnt walk, but it didnt fly. So we were split up whilst I waited outside with him. It was thoroughly bizarre and my other two youngsters get pretty upset when we're split up as they wanted me to see them do the training. Other times we waited at the exit of rides so long that we saw people going back for another go before we'd even had one. With great respect as its not always known, someone needs to educate the cast that autistic kids just cannot wait, and we had to suffer 3 full on meltdowns at their hands.In the Disability area of the fireworks, one night we were allowed in together, the next not. The kids are too young to understand and got really upset when a snarly cast member is telling us we cant come in. We managed to find a spot to sit down on the outside and had better views anyway, although my little one was clung to me as he was so close to the other tourists.Im such a fan Disney, please please sort it out so you dont die a death in Europe!!",0
22097,"My husband and I just recently took our kids to Disneyland. We've been there in the past but my youngest boy hadn't. We'd planned this entire trip just to take him because he brought it to our attention that he'd never gone and he is 11. We have gone many times before and been very pleased but definitely NOT this time!! What a WASTE OF MONEY!! I'd read on recent reviews that the park had gone down hill but couldn't believe it because after all, this is  Disneyland! . I wish I would have listened. EVERY single one of the big rides were broken down except magic mountain and several rides broke while we were in line and had waited a long time. They claimed they are all under  safety maintenance  but ALL AT THE SAME TIME??? It was extremely disappointing and an expensive trip to get there and not be able to show our son how fun Disneyland can be. It appears it's under new ownership and they aren't putting money back into the park. They've also bumped up things you can purchase which made us feel like all they really care about now is how much money they can make in a day off you. I'm sorry but they don't have water mist things in the park like Magic mountain or many shade areas but our main complaint is that everything fun such as  Indiana Jones, BigThunder mountain train, It's a small world, Pirates of the Carribean, Matterhorn, you name it  OUT OF ORDER  and I heard it had been this way for a MONTH!! Yet they are still charging people the full amount and not telling us when we book our tickets online. WE FEEL VERY RIPPED OFF both money wise AND our son's first and probably LAST Disney trip.",0
4203,"My wife and I visited HK Disneyland during a layover between flights. We were hoping it would be just like the one in LA. While it was nicely landscaped and pleasant to walk around, we felt that it was very much geared to families with small children     not teenagers or big kids (like us). It had no Indiana Jones Adventure, no Haunted Mansion, no Pirates of the Caribbean, no Star Tours. They were building an Ironman ride though. It seemed to us, that all the types of rides we were hoping for had been replaced with expensive food outlets and gift shops. So the admission cost was not really value for money in our opinion. Fortunately, the park was not that busy, and we didn't have to fight the queues. We did the whole park in about 3 hours, but left feeling disappointed.",0
31489,"You don't like this place if you have visited Disneyland Hong Kong before visiting here. Rides are old and there are very long queues for rides. You can calculate by yourself that the ride time for Train was 90 minutes.Not enough characters for a photo shoot like Disneyland Honk Kong have. Also, they put all the 3 D and 4 D shows in a separate park and charge more which is not in case of Disneyland, Hong Kong.These 3 stars are for a long one and a half hour queue for a photo with Mickey which was worth a million for a Mickey Mouse fan like me.",0
15668,"We have been here on several occasions now and I have to say we were very disappointed on our last trip. Our 8yr son got crushed by the large volume of people trying to race through a small gate to get the best views of fantasmic. We brought some ice cream from the shop in main street and the staff were really rude to us. We also noticed on our last trip that it was more dirtier around the park than on previous visits from rubbish on the ground to the toilets not being maintained. We were very sad to see so much change with only a year between our visits and for our son to not want to back there, it is supposed to be the  happiest place on earth  well our son doesn't want to go back there.",0
22100,"Long lines, expensive food, nothing new and where was Mickey??? We went to Disneyland 5 years earlier and nothing new. What was missing were the characters. Hardly saw any characters and when we did they were only out for a short amount of time. Overpriced and not worth a second visit.",0
22101,"We had fun anyway, otherwise, this would be a one  star  review. This was a birthday celebration and a reunion for our family of eleven, and we paid over $1000 for admission tickets to Disneyland on Saturday May 3rd. Yes, we checked the website, and saw that our favorite rides (Pirates, Small World, Indiana Jones, Submarine, etc.) were closed for so called  refurbishing  (yet, Small World had been closed for about two years just recently !), however, our non refundable airline tickets had been purchased in January, and at that time the rides were open ! Who would think that half of the top rides would be CLOSED at the same time. So those, plus a few others, were closed. Then, Haunted Mansion broke down twice (we were already inside, when all the lights came on and we were ushered out !), Splash Mountain broke down after we had waited in line for almost 2 hours, the Pinocchio ride broke down, someone came to unlock the bar holding us inside the carts, and we were escorted out. (We had waited to see Pinocchio about 35 minutes!) The rides that were open had lines up to 4 hours long !!!! Too many people, too few operating rides !WHAT IS THIS ??? Is the management not at all embarrassed to collect full admission from people when all this is going on? What terrible customer service ! This is like operating under false pretenses ! You promise fun and magic, and you get lines, more lines and closed or broken rides. And nobody seems to care. When I started complaining, I was told that they have to shut down when the machinery overheats. Well, then install a c units by the machinery! If you can come up with such creative ideas for rides, I am sure you can come up with ideas to cool the machinery ! Or give people partial refunds or discounts, as they did not get what was promised. Or, give them lunch coupons or 50% off at the Disney Store. OR, close the park for a year, and  refurbish  everything. Walt Disney envisioned and built the park for people to enjoy. The management now, is only interested in money !Having said that, we did still manage to have a fairly nice time, as we were all together, and that is always fun. We got to ride Space Mountain, had a wonderful birthday dinner at the Caf   Creole (made reservations a month in advance!), where we were given a lovely table. We saw Fantasmic, and we so enjoyed the fireworks. The weather was pleasant, the crowds were huge, and the Park was (as usual) very clean and tidy. No scraps of paper, no sticky gum or candy wrappers anywhere. However, still cannot understand how management can charge full admission prices to something that is not FULLY operating. Greed is so unattractive..",0
15667,"Have been to Disneyland before, as my wife is a California native. We have also been to many other theme parks all over the country as well. Now, when one goes to a theme park, crowds and long lines, as well as high prices for souvenirs, food, parking, and entrance into the park are to be expected. However, it was so crowded yesterday, you couldn't tell where the lines for the rides were, and walking was nearly impossible! In fact, we relished waiting in long lines, because it gave relief from the pushing, shoving, and getting the backs of your ankles run over by strollers! In eight hours, we were able to get on two rides. The part that will keep us from ever going back, though, was at the end of the day. We had a train to catch, and needed to exit the park to catch a shuttle to the train station at 2130 hours. We left the souvenir shop closest to the gate, no more than 75 yards, at 2100 hours.....it took us OVER ONE HOUR to get out of the gate. There was zero crowd control, and literally no way to move. Had there been a fire or some other emergency, there would have been casualties. BTW: we missed our shuttle.Does Disney not keep track of how many people are in the park? Can they not see the streets are so crowded you cannot move? I would advise folks to avoid this place, or be ready to shuffle, jostle, push, shove, be run over, stepped on, walked on, stepped on, and hoping the lines for the rides are long just so you can get a respite from the crowded streets!There were literally children crying and saying they wanted to go home. I guess it's no longer the happiest place on earth....",0
36517,"We took our kids aged 3 and 7, and had all been really looking forward to it. It wasn't peak season so while it felt busy, it wasn't horribly over crowded. The site is really clean and certainly has plenty of staff. There is a nice feel to the whole place, but we were all just really disappointed by most of the rides that we went on. We queued for around forty minutes for each ride which isn't too bad, but I then felt they were a bit dull and over very quickly. We have had more fun at some of the uk theme parks that we have been to.",0
22103,I took my 5 year old grand daughter and her mom to Disneyland at the end of April. I was very disappointed in this trip. The line were at least 1 1 2   hours long to be on a ride 4 5 minutes. The weather was in the upper 90's. A lot of the rides were down for maintenance and people were just not real nice. Employees were very helpful but I felt bad for the children having to wait so long to go on rides. I understand this is a very popular attraction but it all about the children and the lines were just way to long.,0
4210,"It was a sunny day when I arrived at Disneyland HK. Nowhere to shelter from the Sun. The queue for games was long despite it was just an ordinary Tuesday.  The gift shop was nice. some of the items was overprice, but hey it's Disneyland.",0
33121,"I'll probably be heavily criticised by Disney fans but honestly I just wasn't feeling the magic. Perhaps it was the heat of the summer's day but I couldn't really appreciate any of the rides that I had really looked forward to. Indiana Jones was the most exciting. Ratatouille was worth the queue but most of the others were a disappointment, particularly Pirates of the Caribbean. The closures due to next year's anniversary celebrations were probably a big factor. Was the low point of our Parisian adventure. Unless you're a huge Disney fan save the visit for the US parks. Stick to the magic of Paris. There's more than enough in this wonderful city to delight without being distracted by an American icon. ",0
36513,"Wife and I have been to Disney world in Orlando and even to Disneyland many times. However, we were totally disappointed with the number of closed attractions and general poor maintenance issues we observed everywhere. Disney folks were unhelpful.(or nonexistent). We attended the Wild West in the evening. A great show (at an extra cost). This show helped to salvage our day. All in all, if you have been to Disneyworld or Disneyland you will find this an expensive disappointment. Save you money and spend more time in Paris!",0
22105,"Was so looking forward to this trip with our 3 kids and disappointing is an understatement. We flew all the way from Manila with this attraction foremost in our minds. 5 major attractions   Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Splash Mountain and Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage were closed or was told to get out of line (after an hour of waiting) because the rides had broken down. Whats left of the Disneyland trip after these 5 main attractions. Our kids were heartbroken. Not sure when we will have this same opportunity again.",0
13116,"Very crowded, long lines, high prices, food okay, Worst is when wait in line then after 45 minutes the ride breaks, no recourse. The fastpass is the best way to get around Disneyland. Just need to plan the rides so you can utilize your time as efficiently as possible.",0
36510,"The word around the park when we were there for School break was  I need my Disney Fix . Well a person who has been to Disney (in Flordia) numerous times, this is not the location to go if you are on the European side of the water. The feel, look, operation and name a few things were not even close. Moreso, when you buy premium tickets to use the  Fast Pass  and the ride does not use them or you are given an excuse that they only use fast pass on the weekends make no sense. The only solution is that Disney either fix the park or remove the name. I can honestly say the Family was let down and it was a  Bust  or better yet a waste of time.",0
33123,Park is small but good fun for a short 1 2 night break.Beware its run down and lots of the restaurants rides and attractions are closed or being repaired. example the castle usually has water around it and they were empty with pipes etc all on show (sort of spoils the magic and something you wouldn't see in the USA)My biggest negative point and one I cant begin to accept is the SMOKING.... people can (and do) smoke anywhere   we were watching one of the parades and someone lit a cigarette up next to us (holding 2 small children)   coming from the UK where you are really restricted on where you can smoke I guess we are spoilt but I don't appreciate my children being covered in smoke. The whole place smells of smoke   People were even smoking in the queue for rides. It really put us off.Best ride   Space Mountain,0
30031,I saw Tigger and Jafar. My ride broke down. The rides were nice. The food was dreadful. The staff where friendly. The gift shop was overpriced. The park was overpriced. The super hero acts were the same. But overall a good experience.,0

15678,"Last visited this Disneyland 10 years ago and have great memories, wish I'd left it at that. We were travelling around California and decided to have a day at Disney whilst we were here, the park was as clean and well organised as ever and the staff very helpful and pleasant. Many of the rides were closed, maybe it was the wrong time of year ( April), I don't know, but this was disappointing. Of the rides that were left open, 2 of the main ones that we wanted to do Splash mountain and the Indiana Jones adventure kept breaking down and ended up being closed. Over all this left us feeling that it wasn't worth the effort or expense of visiting Disney at Anaheim.",0
36541,"Thank god that I had a disabled pass that got me and 4 others to the front of the queue or I don't think our 4 little ones would have done half as much! As someone who has done Florida 3 times, this was a shambles in organisation! Princess Pavilion was a must on our list with 3 little girls. So my daughter queued from 9 till 11.30 to get tickets for 12.30. When we went back at 12.30 they said our tickets were for 2.30! Only when I intervened and told them we had reservations at Cafe Mickey at 2 and could not come back, they let us in at 12.30. Then you go in and get to choose 1 of only 2 Princesses! The choices were not any of what the little ones wanted but they chose Merida. She was great with them though even though they told her they really wanted Rapunzel! Oh, and Rapunzel was at her tower and that was another 2 hr wait!It's a shambles of waiting for tickets then going back and waiting to go in. The rest of the Park was good though Dumbo ride and Space Mountain was shut all week.Staff were friendly and plenty of characters walking around so the kids got lots of autographs. ",0
36560,"The magic and sparkle that's advertised is sadly lacking at Disneyland park and the studio park next door. It's an expensive day out and while I really don't have a problem spending my hard earned cash, I felt there wasn't enough to balance the books.Closed attractions, closed food outlets and queues for both. You'll spend more time looking for things and waiting; than actually doing anything fun. Studios closes at 18:30 and the other one closes at 20:00. Two hours wait for the dumbo thing that twirls around, they have those at the local fairground, those poor people with toddlers must have been exhausted.The rides are unimaginative and dated, a couple of  Runaway Train  style roller coasters holds little attraction for anyone over 8. Ratatouille has excellent 3D effects and Tower of Terror was well done.Proper Disneyland caters to children of all ages, even 40 somethings, in my opinion the park is simply not trying hard enough or doesn't particularly care enough about the Disney brand.No sparkle, no shine, no magic.... no return. I'll shell out a bit more and find a flight to Florida next time.",0
36574,"A much smaller version of the Florida park. Attractions for all ages, but not many of them for the crowds it attracts, hence long queues. The higher levels of security means it takes longer to enter.For Easter weekend, a number of the main attractions were closed for refurbishment. No reduction in ticket prices, though. Very disappointing.My daughter loved it, as she always does. It was my first visit. That which is good is excellent, but you have to queue for a long time, and the rides with fastpass ticket availability still managed to make you queue for the ticket. Too many visitors for what's available.",0
8985,"Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest disneyland I've ever been. Unlike the Disneyland in Florida, Disneyland in Hongkong didn't have much ride for adults or a ride that quite thrilling. But it's still Disneyland after all, so I'm still happy with it. The journey to Disneyland is interesting, since the have a special custom MTR, with mickey's head as the window. So you'll never ride a wrong MTR to go to Hongkong Disneyland.",0
15692,"Disney allows TOO many people into the park. They clearly don't care about making the experience pleasant to the guest. They only care about money.I don't understand why they allow California residents to pay few dollars for an annual pass and flood the park at the expense if guests that pay full price. Clearly the California residents do not spend money at the park, they bring food and drinks from home and are significantly less profitable to Disney than out of state guests, yet allowing then to flood the park at the expense of other guests convenience naked no sense.In addition, given how expensive it is, Disney should do better job maintaining their equipment. Nearly one in every 3 rides wad either broken or broke while we were in line.Overall, our experience was not pleasant at all. We now refer to Disneyland as  The most miserable place in the world .We are done with Disney. Our vacation dollars will go much further somewhere else, where you don't have to spend 75% of your vacation time standing in line with sweaty people or spend 15 minutes in line to purchase a bottle of water for $4. Enough is enough.",0
15691,"Just spent 4 days at Disneyland park and California adventure park...we are seasoned Disney visitors, have gone every year for the last 15 yrs or so. Disney has always been heads above all other theme parks in customer service and the product that they deliver, but this year was noticeably different. Cost saving measures are obvious even though prices for everything have gone up. Rides not staffed as well so lines long even if crowds less on the weekdays. Too many rides closed down at the same time so made for longer wait times at open rides. To name a few, grizzly river run, autopia, Matterhorn during the week, the large theatre on Hollywood st. Why is the Matterhorn closed on weekdays? Also rides breaking down frequently while we were in line  cars ride, Alice in wonderland, and tower of terror all broke down while we were in line. Screaming over California not running the entire day on Tuesday. We heard that Disney is so over budget on their Shanghai park that they have cut their budget on the U.S. parks by 20%. Our grandchildren had a wonderful time, but we did notice that the special Disney attention to everything was missing. No one does it like Disney, I hope they don't lose the  magic .",0
8984,"I guess we're spoiled having lived in California just down the road from the original Disneyland. HK Disneyland is a fun day out, but lacks a lot of the rides that you'll see in Disneyland or Disneyworld in Florida. The biggest queues are for the little kids rides (The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh always seems to have the longest queue), whilst Spacemountain is easy to do repeat rides (especially as a single rider). There are good food options and ther's enough to do, that on a day when you're challenged to entertain small children, it's definitely worthwhile. With teenagers, you'll end up on Space Mountain alot!",0
36569,"This was our third trip to Disneyland Paris (previous, magical visits in 2008 and 2009) and I'm sorry to say it will be our last. I was shocked at how 'tired' everything looked and more than a little surprised that a fair number of the rides were closed for refurbishment (during the Easter Holidays, of all times)?! The queues for the (functioning) rides were unforgivably long, with nothing to occupy the kids' time whilst we were waiting. We saw probably three Disney characters in the park during the three days we were there, (excluding those in the parade) and the children were completely disheartened by the lengths of the queues to have their photos taken with them.... needless to say we didn't bother. I didn't really see the point of the Fast Pass system as you can only really use it for one ride per day (possibly two if you can actually find more than one Fast Pass system open at any one time) and on numerous occasions, rides were suddenly closed due to faults and or malfunctions. We actually witnessed people being led down the side of 'Thunder Mountain' as their coaster had broken down halfway through the ride! Hardly the 'Magical Disney Experience' they were expecting, I'm sure. We found eating at lunchtime to be a complete nightmare. One day we actually queued, in an average burger restaurant, for over an hour, only to find the lady who had served us had got our order completely wrong, but hardly surprising considering she was having to contend with dozens of frustrated and angry customers and was clearly feeling more than a little out of her depth. I actually felt sorry for her and was more angered at Disney's utter incompetence towards basic customer requirements.I'm so very sorry to say this time our Disney experience certainly didn't meet our expectations and I won't be recommending it to anybody anytime soon. Very disappointing.",0
15689,"Took the g kids to Disney for the first time, on a Thursday,  off   peak  many lines were still 30 mins long. I have a huge problem with adults riding alone on Fantasyland rides. I know they are paying guests too, but this part of the park is really for the smaller kids. Disney needs to institute some system where this is a kids with adults line or kids alone and adults by themselves line and have the kids line go 2x to adults line. The adults can go many other places in the park that little kids can't go. Or they should have a the express for rides in Fantasyland. Asking a kid to wait 30 mins to ride Dumbo is ridiculous when 1 2 the people in line are adults alone!We were very surprised as to how crowded it was all day, it was not spring break, not any travel cycle, it was the 3rd week in April, on a Thursday.We say 2 characters, when I was kid they were all over the park, where did they all go? The kids of course didn't know any better and had an awesome time but as adults we were a bit disappointed for them.The last thing is ALL the transport that would take you around the park was closed. The paddle wheel ride, the train, plus the Matterhorn, Autotopia, and about 6 other attractions. I know they have to do work on rides and stuff but you had a LOT of stuff closed which also contributed to the long lines everywhere",0
31493,"When we went most of the rides were closed as they were having maintenance, so we could go on them. Which left a lot of the smaller rides open which got crowded very quickly. the disney characters weren't out a lot and only got to see them once.

30013,"I went to Disneyland Paris as part of a school group and whilst the park and neighbouring parks are great, the Customer Services Guest Services was appalling.One of our students was ill and we had to go back to the coach. She felt better so we returned to the park, however she didn   t have her ticket with her, one of her friends inside the park had it. At the turnstile we were told to go to Guest Services thinking they would help, but no.... We were a group of 40 students and 4 staff, we, the staff, all had our tickets which we showed him and I had the confirmation itinerary from our School travel agent but the guy would not let our student through without a ticket... we explained the situation but he had no compassion at all.

36564,"Step back and apply some logical thinking. It's an awful lot of money for not many mediocre rides (and when we went in April, 10% were closed for maintenance). Half of your time will be spent standing around in queues, and you'll be lucky to see any of the characters for a photo opp close up. That said, the parades are good, and the closing show at the end of the day is worth hanging around for. Would we go again? No. but then I'm sure we said that last time    (Europa Park in Germany will get our next visit).",0

We walked for ages to get to the ice cream parlour and it was SHUT. We went to another ice cream kiosk and queued for an hour to get an ice cream   only to be told that the flavours we wanted were sold out. Four major rides NOT working. Apart from parades, hardly any characters just walking around the Park. Prices exorbitant. . It cost 74 euro,   57 to get in the Park and because of all the queuing we only ended up with SIX rides all day   this works out at nearly   10 per ride. No Fast Passes were working. Disneyland was obviously built to accommodate only half of the visitors that were there. We were told by our shuttle driver,  You should see it in the summer, just awful   so overcrowded ! Not the happy, carefree place shown in the adverts. Very disappointed. Looks like Disneyland will be a victim of its own success. We have been to Florida Disneyland twice and this was our third visit to Disneyland Paris. Possibly our last (?!)",0

36554,"This was our 8th time visiting Disneyland Paris since 1997 and I have to admit it has lost some it's magic. Obviously it's be expected as when you're older you notice things you don't register when you're a young child. Firstly, there are no longer characters walking freely around the park. There are select characters in set locations around the park at given times (same characters in the same places everyday). Gone of the days of randomly bumping into a character and getting an autograph or photo. These 'moments' were some of my favourite memories from DLP which children are missing out on I feel. Guessing this change is due to safety concerns for both staff and visitors.Secondly, there are certain areas of the park which need a touch up   painting etc. These little things may not seem much and would cost very little. But the difference would be huge. A friend of mine is currently in Disney World in Florida and says these little things are managed to maintain the Disney magic. It's time to restore Disneyland Paris and bring back the magic!",0
22078,"My husband and I, and our 24 year old daughter, spent a fortune for the two day park hopper. Yes, it had been 16 years since we had last visited,  the happiest place on earth,  but we did not expect how awful our experience would be. First, when I bought the tickets as part of staying at the Disneyland Hotel, the person on the phone should have told me that Friday, May 16th, was Grad Night. Thousands and thousands of unescorted 17 and 18 years olds filling every possible space on the entire property   misbehaving as only 17 and 17 year olds know how to misbehave. IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY THAT WE WORKED VERY HARD TO MAKE. Second, the park was filthy and the rides have not been cleaned in a long time. For example, the bar you would automatically hold during the ride on the Matahorn was so disgustingly dirty, we had no interest in holding the bard. Not surprisingly, we heard various people complaining as we exited the ride. Also, the bruises I got because I was not able to hold on were certainly not worth the experience. Third, it is so clear that Disney only cares about making money. Several of the rides were closed and others had a 90 MINUTE WAIT. Nonetheless, they have no limit to the number of people they allow into the park so at times, you can barely breath because of the number of people around you. Fourth, many of the so called  cast members  are clearly unhappy with their jobs. I don't blame them, actually, when there are thousands and thousands of people running from ride to ride desperate to get a least a little bang for their buck. I could go on and on, but I won't. I highly encourage each and every one reading this that they spend their money elsewhere. I also suggest that Disney management spend the day at the park with someone like me. It won't be me because I do not have the resources to waste another $550. Walt Disney would be rolling over in his grave if he knew how poorly treated the  guests  are at the park. And for what? To make a buck. Shame on you Disney. Shame on you.",0
30017,"The most negative was the waiting times , and that we could not get a coffee without waiting another 30 45 minutes.Also food !!!!!! Disaster......waiting waiting and waiting....second day we decided to bring our own food .....It is not at all what I was expecting....Anyway I have done my duty... I did bring my 8 year old daughter to Disney world ",0
36551,"I when here just after the easter weekend with my wife and two children (5 and 3 year old girl) along with my wife sister and her partner along with their children of the same age (but boys). Expectations were high to be fair, you hear so much about Disneyland that you expect the best and of course pay a premium for such however, the trip itself didn't meet my personal high expectations and I'm not sure if thats just me being fussy or maybe just unlucky?We booked into Newport Bay hotel, which is on site and allows earlier access to the park, two hour before the general public. This hotel itself is being renovated, when we booked we were told 'minor renovations' were being undertaken but came to find the hotel covered in scaffolding and majority of the ground floor lounge etc closed. The first impressions weren't improved upon when our party got stuck in a lift for 20 minutes when trying to make our way to the rooms (which were provided ahead of check in time to be fair).The rooms itself was very standard, views were none existent due to scaffolding and builders working outside the window. The decor looked very dated and I assume is part of whats promoted the renovations (be them classed as minor or major!).The park itself   of course the kids got delirious with excitement when they saw the entrance and given their age, were happy with all the attractions and shows we took them to however, we did find a large proportion of rides close due to faults (thunder mountain, tea cups, big pirate ship, slinky dog, dumbo ..... amongst others).Cost of food in the parks themselves was extortionate and very poor quality. The waiting time for said food was terrible, we went half board and as part of the deal got a 'tea time treat'..... these were used once on all the days there as we found only a few selected places took the vouchers and those that did had waits longer than major rides!!Staff working were generally very good, cheery and happy to help except when on one ride I felt the sharp edge of a young french ladies tongue for returning a hat that had been left on the tom sawyer ride..... I was hoping to catch her name at the end of the ride but she strangely seemed to have disappeared!Character photo opportunities are plenty on the park, albeit with a sizeable queue event before the park opens to the general public. Highlight of the trip for me was the fireworks and light show at the park closing time   that was staggering and breath taking and everyone I spoke to enjoyed it whatever their age.In summary, it was mission accomplished in terms of the kids enjoying themselves however, the trip certainly didn't live up to expectation in terms of quality and value for money.",0
4183,"The park itself not really big the staff it self not really friendly. I was excited to visit HK Disneyland since i like theme park, and that time was my first time for Disneyland. Unfortunately i was disappointed about this place. I didn't know about other Disneyland but compare to other Theme park i went, i am sorry that i'm not impress. If you guys interest taking photo with Disney characters better to go early and straight away queuing, otherwise there would be long line due to lack of Disney characters. ",0
36549,"Probably spoilt by having visited Disney Orlando a few times, Euro Disney was a major disappointment.

13955,"I have been visiting Disney for over 40 years, we are season pass holders who visit a few times a year. This is the first time we have encountered so many broke down rides and rude employees. Its like the whole culture at Disney has changed and they need to get it back quick.",0
36546,"In the words of disneyland paris this review is being refurbished for your future enjoyment. There were too many rides closed at the same time, the refurbishments should've been staggered better as the queues are bad enough without having more rides closed. We stayed in a hotel and one of the selling points was the extra 2 hours in the park you get over day visitors, this would be good if half the park was open in these 2 hours.",0
6653,"I am so glad that I have been lucky enough to go to the parks in the states and Disneyland Paris. This allowed me to compare this park to the others. Our family of 4 with two teens included have now been to all parks apart from Tokyo. Our least favourite park was HongKong in fact it was the bottom of our list by a long way. We disliked the food that may have been the fact that we prefer western style food. The small amount of western food available was poorly done in fact my daughter fed most of hers to the birds. The park itself was clean and pretty but small and the staff lacked personality. The castle was small and I felt lacked the feeling you get from the other parks. We did enjoy the Mystic manor and was my favourite ride, we also enjoyed the addition of the Disney characters in its a small world but apart from that we were disappointed with the rides. My children said space mountain was the worst one in all the parks they had visited. The merchandise available was also boring and lacked variety compared to other parks. If this is to be your first time at a Disney park dont bother save for a little longer and go to one of the better parks. As you can tell I was disappointed maybe if I had nothing to compare it to I would have felt differently.",0

22084,"Check to see when it's grad night........then avoid at all cost!! It was overrun by middle schoolers and high schoolers that thought they were cool and therefore thought that they could climb on the displays while they were standing in line. So annoying. Moving through the park was almost impossible it was so crowded.To add insult to injury, there was one point where Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain, Pirates, It's a Small World were all closed. Which made lines everywhere else 2  hours. There was nothing else to do but ride the winnie the pooh ride.Apparently, May is still their  slow  season, which is probably why they were closing the rides. Other tips:1. I'd definitely leave the time energy to watch the World of Color at the closing time of California Adventure. This mean that you need to get a fastpass to the show at the very beginning when you enter the park. It may also mean that you may need to skip the fireworks at Disneyland. 2. Get the app that tells you how long the wait times are! I forget what it's called, but my aunt had it on her phone. It would tell you if rides were closed so you don't have to go all the way over just to discover that it's closed. The wait times were relatively accurate, off by maybe 5 10 minutes at the most. 3. Turkey legs. Amazing ($9.75). One feeds a billion people, and is perfectly seasoned smoked. Get them in Frontierland in Disneyland, or at Paradise Pier in California Adventures4. Pack a wallet if you do not want to bring your own food. We almost spent as much on park admission as we did on food snacks throughout the day.",0
29989,"As a family, we love this park but its in desperate need of expansion and improvement. Unlike Florida you can do everything you want or need to in 2 3 days (across both parks). There are lots of good tips to get the best out of the park, but for rides, plan your fast passes to get onto the rides you need to   Big Thunder Mountain seemed to be the one you needed to get done early   but if staying at a Disney hotel you get early access to the park, so Space Mountain is one to get done without the need to queue for long, as is Buzz Lightyear. Be prepared to queue if you need to. The water fountains are busy but do use them, as the biggest problem with the park is if you have to buy anything. Prices are extortionate. The early part of our week was during a heatwave, so it was pretty difficult to keep water from the fountains cool, so you were forced to buy in the park. Water and Fanta Coke cost 3.50 euros, 3 times the price they are at home. The park is pretty easy to navigate but pick up a map to help, and to check out showtimes etc. If its hot there are plenty of shaded areas, if its raining there are plenty of sheltered areas. Staff cast members are all friendly and helpful if needed, plus multi lingual. Overall its still good, but they need to stop taking advantage of their guests, which is na  ve, I know.",0

36743,Ok .....rides shut no notice before you go ..no vegetarian only restaurants...toilets clean but could do with attendants to stay on top....could do with designated smoking areas..long queues average about 90minutes and as you can only get one fast pass at a time you have not much choice...no characters just wandering around like what you see on adverts ...they have designated times for a few of them but in 10 hours never saw any...very expensive ...did go to the buzz lightyear pizza very good food and price but had to queue for 40 minutes to get a table this was at one pm as we has a fast pass to star tours for 3pm..liked the pirates ride and the star tour also the back lot in warner lot ...staff walking around guides etc are very friendly polite and really the best ....mixed feelings really but have done once and never again ..if you go by train it stops at the entrance car parks are a bit of a walk away and not free.,0
15759,"Having visited Orlando, Hong Kog and Paris Disney theme Parks, this one is definitely the worst. Orlando by far the best.

4064,"I have been a consistent patron of Disney for years. I never miss a trip to Disney for all my travels. Their rides are still enjoyable no matter how many times you ride ... making it timeless. New attractions and shows are being introduced. My rant is that there are an increasing number of queue cutters or line breakers. Be careful not to let your child ride by themselves, they will never be able to. ",0
21981,"We planned our magical disney vacation with our 3 grandchildren 8,6, and 3 years 9 months ago. We chose to go the beginning of May as spring break was over, school still in session and we wanted less crowds. We were giddy with excitement when that time came but alas, it was not to be. Upon entering the park a small sign informed us that 7 of the attractions would not be working during the three days we were there, 5 of them were major! They had to get them in ship shape condition for the summer crowds...really, 7 rides at once? We paid just as much as someone visiting in the summer but received far less. Probably the worst thing was the  Magic Morning . We anticipated no lines for one hour before the park opened to the general public. Well, everyone else had magic morning passes too it seemed and to our horror, all early morning customers were funneled into Fantasy Land as the rest of the park was closed. The crowds were crushing! We stood in line 40 minutes for Peter Pan, but when it was almost our turn they suddenly shut the ride down due to technical difficulties! Our  magic morning  turned into a  miserable morning . We then went to adventure land and waited for 15 minutes for them to open the gates so we could be first in line to ride Big Thunder Mountain, then we dashed over only to find it was closed due to technical difficulties! This went on and on all day long and we only rode 5 rides and we were there from 8:30 am till 8:00 at night! The whole day was a joke, so disappointing. We expected the joy and magic we felt as children, and when we took our own young children. I can't believe Disney treated us as they did, we felt scammed and ripped off and next time we want to bond and enjoy our grandchildren in a magical place we will rent a beach house. We never want to go back!",0
9022,Been there once only.  It is a bit small compared to the Disneyland elsewhere in the world but I think one can consider to spend half day there.  Better to go in the morning to avoid the crowd.,0
21979,"The rollercoasters are decent and the setting is cool, but unless you are really into Disney and feeling sorry for adults trying really hard to smile and wave all day long maybe you could do better than a day here, if you are going here with a tour you might be stuck here for a long time so make sure you know what you are getting into.",0
36742,"Think very hard about when you go. We went in half term, queues up to two and a half hours long, the kids could not tolerate it, nor could we! Probably 25% of the rides either being upgraded or broken down, numerous break downs every day across the park,in disney and the studios. We did not book restaurants before we went, big issue, we could not eat in one restaurant that we wanted to either at all or at the time we wanted. So book before you go!!! (Unless you are happy to eat at either 5pm or 10pm) Highlight of holiday was wild west show, it was brilliant fun, again book before you go. Expect to spend AT LEAST 90% of your time in a queue, either for rides or for food and drink, ie queue for peter pan was hour and a half, ride lasted 60 seconds or so. In studios again many many break downs, there were two cinema experiences next door to each other both showing in french at the same time, surely it makes sense to do one in english and one in french at same time? Queued for an hour for another cinema experience, sat in seats for ten minutes to be told yet another break down, please leave. I am baffled as to how Disney has brain washed us in to think this is either acceptable or enjoyable, but you know why of course, because the kids love disney. Also if you fly try and land within the hours that Disney runs the shuttle buses, we had terrible experience stuck st airport let down by shuttle we had ordered via internet, if you do risk it do not pay in advance as they will more than likely not show up. We went to information desk at airport at 9.29pm to be told they would not speak to me as they shut at 9.30pm, I said i just needed advice on how to get our party with three small children to disney, they refused to talk to me. Charming. So this was very stressful. We were also not alone in being let down by shuttle others at airport also stuck, all different companies as well and very common by all accounts. I researched thoroughly and read a lot of reviews but still got stung! Disney break downs and shut offs while we were there   ratatouille, thunder mountain, cinemagique, buzz lightyear, pinnochio, videopolis, fantasyland railway station, star tours   need I go on? Best food we had was at wild west show and blue lagoon restaurant, but we were unable to get in any of the highly rated restaurants. Also if you are queueing for long periods and the weather is also cold it starts to get painful, so take hats, gloves, thermals and warm boots, my hands and feet go so cold they hurt, but obviously it was february so we were expecting cold weather but we forgot to take into account being stood still in queues for hours on end.",0
36744,"Disney spent millions of Euro, Dollar, Pounds, building this place but failed to address the basic needs of children who cannot leave their wheelchairs! The park itself is accessible by wheelchairs but I believe this is purely because strollers   pushchairs are used rather than any thought of wheelchair access. This shows with the lack of drop curbs and where they do exist on one side of a road, they are not on another.There are also NO disabled changing facilities in the park. This meant we had to change our daughter on the floor of the toilet or as we had to do leave the park and return to our hotel to change her. Something which took a considerable amount of time and had to then re enter the park. They should speak to http:  www.changing places.org  on how to fit a changing room.On arrival you can go to the  Town Hall  where on proof of disability you are given a Green Priority card which outlines the disability. This provides you with no queuing access to rides and attractions.The reason I think it looks like wheelchair   disability access is an afterthought is that all the disabled access seems to be via the access of the rides and you have to go against the flow of sometimes 100's of people to get access. Some of who do not know that and can abuse you for going the wrong way. Also on some of the rides the staff try to load the wheelchair before everyone has exited the ride! This was particular on the flying carpets.Only 4 rides in the park seem to be used with a wheelchair and even then the staff refused us access to one of the rides because our wheelchair did not look  wheelchair  enough!! Not given the fact that our daughter who is 8 and has severe 4 limb cerebral palsy was obviously not able to sit unaided in the boat! only after a very loud argument causing embarrassment and distress were we finally allowed on the adapted boat for the Small World ride. The following day we put in a complaint at the town hall. We did feel our complaint was taken seriously. The Wonderful World of Disney does not seem to apply to those children who are always in wheelchairs. The majority of rides are for transfer from wheelchair only meaning that although you can get priority access to the ride you have to transfer out of the wheelchair to ride it. Many of the rides that have transfer only access do not have suitable seating for disabled children as they are just the plastic bench seats. What was upsetting   disappointing was the fact that some of the attractions that you would expect to be able to take a wheelchair on could not, such as the Disney train that goes around the park. How difficult is it to adapt this? the boats that show the classic childrens' stories requires transfer and even the tea cups need a transfer! We did not want or expect the major rides such as Hollywood Hotel, Parachute drop etc to be accessible as these are unsuitable for a child with severe disabilities, but there is no excuse for the basic ones.We found the staff on the Buzz Lightyear ride extremely helpful and the ride was a perfect example of wheelchair adaption. A mention must go to the staff on Armageddon who prior to the show talked us through exactly what was to happen, where to stand and most importantly how to exit the attraction quickly should our daughter become distressed. We were with a member of staff throughout and felt the staff had a full understanding of our needs   constraints.Whilst the park itself is a nice walk around with the wheelchair it is a disappointment having paid to come only being able to access about 4 rides. I think some work needs doing by Disney to allow the inclusion of children who are bound to their wheelchairs. The question is will they do it? I think sadly the answer is no, because they make their money! We did enjoy our holiday as it was our first one in 8 years since the birth of our daughter, we thought Disney would understand the needs of wheelchair bound children and were left sadly disappointed.This review will be absorbed into the 1000's of families who had a truly wonderful time, which I can say we would have had we not had a child in a wheelchair.",0
21993,"I visited both Disneyland parks on my visit and as I had a park hopper ticket I entered the Disneyland park on both the 22nd may and 27th may 2014. The first day I visited I visited as we had finished everything in the other park and had a bit of time to kill before the Disney California adventure parade, we entered the park at about 2pm for a few hours, my first impression was that it was fairly cramped and much smaller than I expected, as it was the afternoon the park was obviously very busy, but being that packed on a Thursday I would never have gone there on a weekend or holiday! I have been to disney world a few times and have been to disneyland paris nearly every year for about 14 years as it is so much closer to home. As a frequent disney visitor I know that you have to get there early so wasn't surprised to see the long lines mid day. Saying that though we did manage to ride two toon town rides, the haunted mansion and mr toad which all had about a 30 minute line.On Tuesday we went to the park for the full day we got there about 8:45 and got a near front position at the rope drop, we then headed straight to the Matterhorn as we knew the line would get long in the day we were in line about 10 15 minutes which was good compared to the line later in the day. We then headed over to get an Indiana jones fast pass and rode pirates of the Caribbean which had about a 10 minute line. We then rode the used our Indiana fastPasses and went over to thunder mountain to get a fast pass, we then went on the jungle cruise which had a wait time of about 25 minutes, by this time it was about 12 and as we walked back past pirates the line time there was already 40 minutes.Throughout the day we rode Pinocchio which we walked straight on to, it's a small world with a 10 minute wait, Peter Pan with a 45 minute wait, Snow White with a 20 minute wait and buzz with a 15 minute wait, storybook canal with a 40 minute wait. We managed to ride all the rides by about 3 with a few breaks, star tours had a 40 minute wait by the time we got too it as it isn't a favourite ride of mine I wasn't too bothered and space mountain and finding nemo were closed during our visit. With a well planned day you should be able to fit most things in, if you have been to a disney before you know how it works as they are similar in terms of what rides get lines, if you have children dumbo gets very busy so you may need to factor that in.It was a good day out overall, but with a tiny castle compared to others and very small cramped lines in places I have had much better disney experiences hence my score.",0
29951,"I'm a huge Disney fan! I love all things Disney...... except Disneyland Paris. It is an embarrassment to the Disney name. * Lack of maintenance, the park looks tired to say the least* poor hygiene, toilets are dirty * Lack of staff in every respect in every area and every department there is a vast lack of cast members.* hardly any characters! Forget the adverts with the Disney Character's around the park, no chance!!! Try queing for hours if your lucky, all the marvel characters are usually fully booked prior. * poor mannered, miserable, rude, slow cast members. * poor management, try asking for a manager, no chance! They have tens of thousands of people turn up a day, you don't matter. It's a take it or leave it scenario. In conclusion, save up for a bit longer, bite the bullet and go for a once in a life time trip to one of the American Disney's, they are truly magical and the Americans know how to do customer service.As the American Cast Members say 'have a magical day!!'",0

12339,"Visited Saturday through Monday, Incredibly busy all the time (Saturday was the quietest day and we had an early admission ticket ) the Fast ticket system does work with a bit of thought but the really busy rides ( the water ride) never had less than a 2hr queue or a fast ticket ride 2 3 hours in the futureThe show over the lake was good ( what we saw of it through the crowds) and we managed to get a vantage point by the station to see the parade which my youngest daughter loved. Take my advice if your kids are anything over 7, give the Small Small World ride ( and the queue for it) a missFavourite rides were Space Mountain, The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Pirates of the Caribbean We did Disneyland and California land and hopped between the two for the three days we all preferred California Land hands down",0
36748,"Have visited Disney on both sides of the Atlantic many times over the years, so we absolutely knew what to expect. Popped over to see the grandchildren on their first ever visit. The little ones loved it, but we were looking through adult eyes. Everything's become a little tired and in dire need of a bit of TLC! The pavement in many places, particularly on the way through to the entrance, has been patched with completely unmatched concrete, both in colour and style, and there were many small paving stones with writing on that were uneven and wobbly. We arrived just as the Park opened, hoping to have something hot for breakfast, however, the restaurants had not yet opened,so we made our way to the Market House Deli. Dreadful! The place was dirty and did not look like it had been cleaned properly the previous evening. The food was horrible and made with poor ingredients: we chose a ham and cheese ciabatta style baguette, hoping to have it toasted, but this was not an option. We were unable to eat it: the ham was cheap, nasty and preformed, the cheese definitely past it's best. The bill for 3 hot drinks and 2 of these sandwiches came to some 25 Euros, which we felt was a complete rip off even accounting for Disney prices! The park still retains much of it's magic, but we were disappointed to notice many of the little shops and most of the vending carts were closed, all of which gives the impression of economy and detracts from the whole over the top Disney ethos. Rides that were open were not operating to capacity despite waiting times of up to 25 minutes! Many of the Fastpasses were not open at all! I know we have visited off season, but to have attractions like Phantom Manor and Dumbo the Flying Elephant  closed for maintenance  with no evidence of any actual maintenance being done all slightly mars what should (and has always previously been) a truly fairytale experience.The toilet facilities we visited were poorly maintained and dirty.We assumed that in this day and age Disney would automatically have free wifi throughout the park, but sadly, we were wrong.Finally, and perhaps worst of all, is the fact that smoking seems to be permitted throughout the park! Quite apart from the potential fire burning hazard of children walking into a lit cigarette, it was most unpleasant for my 7 year old asthmatic grandson to have other people's smoke inflicted on him!Sadly,the gap between Disney in America and France has widened yet further: France is definitely the poor, shabby relation!",0

Whilst his stay he bought me a mikey and minnie photo frame as a gift to bring home. Though when he got it home, I discovered the shocking quality of this product. The material was peeling of the back and stand, the paint work looks like it's been done by a toddler with a crayon, and the general quality of the product is just disgraceful.I would advise in future you review the quality of the products for sale in your resort shops, to avoid further disappointment. Your shabby photo frame ruined what was supposed to be a romantic gesture. Well done disney. ",0
29954,"I was bursting with excitement at finally visiting Disneyland, I bought my Minnie ears on the way in and skipped through the entrance gates, but what a disappointing anti climax this place is! It quickly became apparent that there are very few decent rides when it comes down to it and the queues are ridiculous. I am realistic and expected to queue and explained to the kids they would have to be patient but after four hours and only two rides they were beyond bored and it became heartbreaking while we tried to gee them on to wait for yet another ride that had then broken down. There are hardly any Disney characters circulating the park and long queues to meet the few who were there. Compared to Port Aventura, Alton Towers and Puy du Fou this place falls very short! I think if you have very small children who like little rides you will be ok and get your money   s worth but anything over 8 years old and there are better places to go.The one plus point is the clean toilets, that   s the only thing I can be positive about. I   m so disappointed ",0
29955,"I   m going to cut straight to the chase.Disney Paris is a joke.People need to take off their rose tinted romantic glasses and look at the place for what it is. Everything, and I mean everything is geared towards taking your eyes out and pissing you off and creating suffering. I   m not going to slag off any of the cast members for being rude as I didn   t see any of that.My issue was to do with the experience itself. There is no way that the park is geared toward children at all. If it was, the process for getting your kids on a ride would have been better engineered or managed. The times for the display at night would have been more focused for small kids too. 11pm for the Final closing show and kids sitting on concrete for 2hrs before to get half a good view. No good got my 2 small children.It was incredible to experience to watch parents making small their children wait for over 60  min for a 30sec Peter Pan ride.I seen 3 4 years olds lying on the floor looking exhausted in the longest queues I   ve ever seen. Tantrums, crying and arguments between couples. It is all well and good getting a fast pass if you want to go on one of the rides for older kids (p.s they don   t work as well as you would expect.) But none of the rides for small children who are a lot more exposed in every way to tiredness etc are organised that way. We went for a fast past for one of the rides at 10am in the morning and was giving a time at 10pm that night to return... bare in mind we now couldn   t use that fast pass entitlement until we had been on that ride. Effectively wiping out any point in having one. They don   t tell you that you have to queue for absolutely everything.We queued for 40min in our hotel when we got dropped off just to get our room.We then queued for 25min to try book tables for restaurants over the next few day... to avoid queues.Then we queued for our photo passes for ages. Remember we haven   t even left the hotel yet and we had been queuing for over 2hrs. Expect to queue for any toilet Expect to queue for any food (which is terrible)Expect to queue for park accessExpect to queue for every rideExpect to queue for every single thing.The majority of our trip was standing in a queue. I honesty don   t understand how anyone can justify this as being a positive experience. This may sound obvious but seriously it   s something to consider. 95% of the spoken language on the attractions etc is in French. Now this may seem silly that I mention this but my little 4 year old girl loves marvel. The shows and experiences etc were predominantly in French. I could see how much she was gutted by not really understanding what was going on.The closing show at 11pm. Most of the Disney songs are sang in French. Yes there is the odd English songs and narration on rides but trust me.. you better brush up on your French $77 for an adult meal (for example) in the park so plan ahead for snacks and drinks.What I will say is that the magic bus and all the shuttles worked amazing. They were very dependable and just worked really well.I will never go back there as long as I live (Paris). I should have took my friends advice and gone to Florida. Next we try it we will not try to cram in all in 3 days and take 2 weeks with a villa. Take our time and go when the littles ones are older. All this can be boiled down to poor planning, wrong time of year from us as parents I must admit... but at the end of the day an expensive like this which should be positive and enjoyable shouldn   t be so forced.Bare all this in mind when your thinking about spending   2k  for a long weekend in Paris.Save your money and go to America and do it properly. Don   t get hung up on the distance. We flew from the uk and by the time we arrived and got set up in the hotel with all the waiting times and transfers, it took 7hrs form start to finish. I though it would be a lot quicker with it just being a small hop... go to America.",0
25968,"If you go to Disneyland you need to do your homework   we didn't. We figured the (expensive) tickets were all we needed  but didn't know anything about how the Fast Pass system works, how the Magic Morning only applies to Disneyland (not Adventureland) and most parts of Disney are roped off. You can also get in early to start the 'fast pass' process   but we didn't know anything about that. And the Fast Pass machines are not that easy to find. The best viewing spots for the night time show at Adventureland (World of Colour) are also roped off unless you have  fast passed  a reserved spot, and rides close early when the show is 30 min away. The lines are long, people seem to be grumpy (I actually had another parent confront me in line to tell me I had 'cut in' even though I was patiently waiting there with my 4 year old for over 10 minutes and was behind the same people the whole time).It's almost like you need 'insider info' before you go   we didn't have it and found the whole thing overwhelming, stressful and disappointing. We did a 3 day pass   should have done 1 day and spent the rest of the time relaxing at the hotel pool where the kids had more fun.",0
4071,We visited on Monday only to find 2 of the main rides closed (space mountain and the runaway train) We were only advised of this after we purchased our tickets Considering the park is so small this led to a very disappointing dayThere were no details of this on the website and no ticket reduction offeredIf we had been made aware of the closures we could have arrange an alternative date when I'm sure would have fully enjoyed the Disney experience despite it being a small park.,0

36728,Went to Disneyland Paris with my daughter and relatives. The trip was very expensive and a bit of a disappointment. The French people were not very welcoming and I'm sorry that we didn't pay a little bit more and go to Disney in America. There was no magic and certainly no good will throughout the whole experience. If you want real Disney I definitely would not recommend Paris.,0
4073,"It was a great sunny afternoon to visit this wonderful attraction. Being a Monday, it was less crowded and waiting time for the rides was bearable. Unfortunately, the attractions at Tomorrowland were under improvements. Without those thrills and action, it was quite a disappointment. Felt a bit short change.",0
4074,Compared to the Disneylands in the USA it's a bit small but none the less a lot of fun activities available for the whole family.There is a mtr station at the door step making it easily accessible.Downside when I visited were the queues.very long lines for any activity and found it very crowded also....might have been due to the school holidays.,0
36725,"I've been to universal in Orlando plus other theme parks which are associated in the U.S.so maybe my expectations were too high to begin with, we arrived on 3rd of March 2015, after dropping our bags at the hotel we headed straight for the theme parks, excited with our 3 year old Daughter in tow, as we had just arrived we felt peckish and felt we should eat before attacking the theme parks, so we stopped at a little place in the disney park served fast italian food ie readymade pizzas, garlic bread and pasta, was a bit expensive but was bearable, went to as many attractions as we could, the map you get either from your hotel or lots of them on entry to the park, found a few of the rides suitable to my daughters age not working, although out of season, queues wer from 1  1 2 hours, one or 2 were 35 minutes, meeting princesses a dissapointment, had to queue for almost 2 hours mostly in like a one way narrow corridor with nothing to distract or entertain kids, and when you get there your asked if you've been before i replied no and we were led to a curtain which was pulled back to reveal 1 princess which happened to be Ariel, but you had no choice, you get a few seconds and a picture which costs a minimum of    15 to buy, met mickey mouse another day waited 1 1 2 hours with old mickey mouse cartoons showing in a few languages, at least it was something for the children,all you can eat buffet ROBBERY!    29PP Adult and    16 per child, for cold slop, lasagne spagetti bol, fish stew pus other unrecognisable food none of which are labelled and are just sitting on a hot plate, Drinks not included, and only fruit salad or pasteries which look nice for desert, not even a bit of ice cream, also ventured into walt disney studios, saw live interactive lilo and stitch show, no real queue, Junior disney was great as it actually involed children in waiting area and got them dancing, GOING ON A BIT, ill summarise, my 3yo favourite lilo and stitch show, Disney junior, aladdins carpet, buzz lightyear, ratatouille, peter pan ride, tea cups, space rockets, Amazing firewoks, parade a bit dissappointing and loads more, place was a bit dirty, Not enough places to sit except cold walls, VERY COLD WRAP UP., self flushing toilets that scared my lo who was terrified to go to the toilet, gift shops expensive, obviously, but same prices exactly in the hotel giftshop and no carrying them around all day. Hope this helps someone who is thinking of going, i'll answer any questions sent to me OH AND BY THE WAY, ther is a MC DONALDS prices only slightly different to home, but queues are mental, it's down past planet hollywood.",0
36724,"2nd time at Disneyland Paris in 20 years. It sems that it has not changed much other than adding a 2nd park (Studios, which I did not visit). The original park is the larger one of the 2 and offers attractions for the little ones as well as teenagers and adults. Studios is smaller and mostly for older children (thrill rides), not as much for small kids. Eating at the park is more expensive than what we are used to with the US Disney parks. Lots of people but not overly crowded.",0
36723,"It cost 15 euros to park over 1 km from the entrance! Which supermarket or store charges you to park when you are there to spend money? Entrance to just one parc for 2 adults and an 8 year old was 211 euros. On the internet it said that one child goes free with one full adult price. Of course this turned out to be only on the internet and of course when you are travelling and staying in a hotel, it is so easy to print out such a ticket! One third of the rides was closed. Most rides took 50 minutes queueing for a non descript experience of 90 to 120 seconds. A small bottle of Perrier cost 3.95 and there was no candy floss and nowhere to even have a beer. Went into the steak house to try and find solace with a good piece of meat and a glass of wine and that was closed! The rest of the food seemed to be only lousy American junk food! What a rip off, what a come down for the kids. I would not go there again even if they paid me 1000 euros! But yet they were selling annual season tickets which apparently were  rentabilise  or became worth it after the second time! Christ, they have to be kidding! Who would ever want to go back there after the first time? It is more like a punishment, like going to prison. The only thing going for the parc is a few Disney characters, though you even have to wait for Mickey Mouse to meet him (another 50 minutes)!!! FAR BETTER GOING TO A LOCAL FUNFAIR AND HAVING FUN ON THE DODGEMS, ROLLER COASTER AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS. Far cheaper as well!",0
9019,"As much as I want to like HK Disneyland, both times I have gone I have left disappointed. The crowds are out of control   you can hardly walk at times! I felt annoyed as the waiting time for rides, restaurants, anything really, was just ridiculous. Unless you are a very patient person with very patient children I would avoid it.",0
24125,"We visit Disney 2 3 times a year with our daughter and her family. Our last visit in June was disappointing. It appears as thought the philosophy of Disney is changing to: Give us your money and we will give you nothing in return. First, the park was dirtier than we had ever seen it. In ToonTown, we wanted to sit on a bench; however, we discovered a dirty diaper and then moved a another bench, where we encountered another dirty diaper. Granted dirty diapers are the fault of sloppy, inconsiderate parents; however, I think Disney needs a greater commitment in keeping the park clean. There was more litter on the grounds than we had ever seen before. Yes, the lines were long even mid week and the park is crowded. There no longer seems to be a quieter time to go to Disney. That is to be expected; however, we went to one ride only to discover that it was closed. We went directly to another ride and it too was closed. We experienced more shut down, out of order rides than we had ever experienced on previous visits. One afternoon, we took our four year old granddaughter to Lunch with the Princesses. She enjoyed it very much. Each of the featured princesses stopped at our table and talked to her. They were patient in posing for pictures. The princesses made the event very worthwhile; however,while service was good, the entrees were served cold and we did not like the taste of the food. My husband ate one or two bites and then could not eat any more. The bus system to and from the park and hotels is slow. We waited 30 minutes for our bus to take us to the hotel. In the mornings, the wait was equally as long. With all the money Disney charges for admission, I think the bus system could be improved. The charges for admission seems to keep going up, and the services keep going down.",0
33096,"You cannot take five steps without finding another vender of Disney products.  Not enough rides, too many people for the amount of space.  Toilets are few and far between.  Map is not easy to read.  We felt trapped with no way to get out.",0
24127,Was there for my grandson's 5th birthday and there is no way I will ever go back. $15 parking was the first price gouging and from then it was downhill. $ 90 for a young child; 30 minute or more for one of the lesser rides; overpriced junk food. The kids seemed to have a good time so we stuck it out to the bitter end. I don't see how a family of six could spend much less than $1000 for the day. I can think of many better ways to entertain young children.,0
29945,"There were lots of people there. The fast pass system worked well, but there were lengthy delays. There were plenty of refreshment stands, with lengthy lines waiting for service; for example it took 45 minutes to get coffee. For older people there just was not enough shaded seating to take a break. The food was horrible, cold and stodgy by the time you made it through the lines. Planet Hollywood is the place to eat; good food and service.Tips for the high tourist times; prebook your fast passes, pay attention to the main shows AND ARRIVE 2 HOURS EARLY. Be prepared for lengthy wait times by having light snacks and drinks at hand. People sit to wait and when the shows start, they stand. The shows were very good, especially the grand finale, simply spectacular.",0
29944,"Second year in a row i came with my 8 years old and 14 years old and I   m not impressed. First time i thought maybe I   ll give them the benefit of doubt , maybe we came in their off season but this time i realize it   s just the way they do business here. Been to other Disney land and Disney world and it   s a lot different. Lack of staff is surprising. No photographers in sight for family pictures but they still sell you a photo pass for 70   .They close all the bathrooms 1 hour before the fireworks and only 2 are open on each end of the park which is ridiculous. The Disneyland Hotel is suppose to be 4 or 5 stars? More like 3 to me. Needs major revamping. Food is not good but they charge like a 5 star restaurant. Wifi internet doesn   t work 90% of the time and when it does it   s really slow. Not more than 10 tv channels. Staff at the hotel are nice i must say. They really sell on the whole magical thing but if you   re going to pay over 12000    for a 5 day stay with nothing included then I   d rather get the bang for my buck. ",0
9032,Hongkong disneyland was a fun trip. Its best to catch the several shows going on. Going on the safari was fun. The food available is nothing to write home about. The experience could be much better in pleasanter (non humid weather),0
21949,"The park itself is lovely and very detailed, but it seems like it is run down by the management.A lot of the main attractions were closed for refurbishment or other reasons when we were there. Among others:  Finding Nemo ,  It's A Small World ,  Indiana Jone's Adventure  and  Pirates Of The Caribbean .While we tried to enter  Innovations  the fire alarm went off and the building had to be evacuated.After that we were waiting in the sun for an hour to go for a ride in the  Matterhorn Bobsleds , only to be told that there was a technical failure and it wouldn't continue for at least another half hour.By noon it got very crowded in the park and it was almost impossible to enter any of the remaining major attractions without Disney's Fastpass or standing in line for hours.No fun at all.",0
36783,"It is with a heavy heart to write not necessarily the best review for a park that as a family we love. As ever the Disney experience is great the whole atmosphere and decorations but the staff do not give you that 100% Disney experience, they do not seem motivated and don't get into character. We have visited this park many times and also Florida and LA there really is no comparison when it comes to enthusiasm. The toilets opposite Peter Pan were dirty by lunchtime and not a cleaner in site. Unfortunately for us Space Mountain was shut but that's the way it goes safety is always important and in most parks there is always something shut for maintenance, this we were aware of before we booked as it was clearly stated. Not alot has really changed over the past 20 years in this park and it now needs something new. Luckily for us we went back into the park in the evening and the firework show really is the saving grace, it certainly is spectacular and not to be missed. As with all theme parks food overpriced but a reasonable priced ice cream can be had opposite It's a small world 3.99euros for 3 scoops so relatively good for a theme park.",0
4029,"This is the second Disneyland I have been to after the one in Anaheim. It was my first trip to Hong Kong however and perhaps the review I'm leaving is due to having not experienced the culture here or the people, but it was my experience.The pushing and shoving to get onto each ride was ridiculous. Mothers yanking their screaming children past others to get good seats. I was trodden on multiple times, had my face scratched by umbrellas and selfie sticks (which are prohibited but not policed). On every ride we went on all you could see were the flashes from cameras. On the Mystic Manor ride you couldn't see the projections because everyone was filming it.Aside from the other people there, half of the park was not open. There was a typhoon warning 3 when we arrived and were told none of the outdoor rides would be open at all. Then when we left at 2pm we were told the outdoor rides were about to open (good thing we didn't leave). All the while all of tomorrow land was closed.We ended up going on about 4 rides multiple times as they were our only options, while getting pushed and shoved and blinded by flashes.",0
13943,Disneyland was okay! I guess it would be a different story traveling with family   I was completely exhausted after arriving at 8:30 till 7:30pm   and that was just me on my own with my partner can u imagine traveling with young children? Oh my. I guess it is a park that u do in multiple days instead of just one   however the ticket was quiet expensive just for entry!I don't think I will return when I visit California again. ,0
29930,"Some of the charm of the place was worn away by the crowds and long, long, long, long waiting lines. Oh yes, did I mention the long lines? We were a bit disappointed that Frontierland was closed for renovations. Bring lots of energy. Having been there in the fall (and remembering the visit fondly) we were amazed that the summer would take so much away from out visit.",0
15785,"New generation Indian Kids are not very conversant with Mickey , Mini and their friends, so we dint find this very exciting. We have seen more better theme parks in SE Asia.The signage and directions were poorly given, so we got lost in the park a few times,,especially after we stepped out, could not figure out the way , we had entered the park in the morning.

9034,"I love Disney and have visited Paris, Orlando and Hong Kong. Don't event think this is going to be like the Disney at Disney World in Florida. It is tiny, the castle is more like a castle ette, but Disney still has that magic no matter what country it is in. This is a great Disney for a first time experience but if you have been to other parks before you are going to be disappointed. One major recommendation   eat before you go. Main Street USA has very few, if any Western restaurants, most are geared towards the Chinese palette. Space mountain is a great ride, and Small World is great too. The jungle experience where you go down the river on the river boats is exactly the same as the one in Florida and the Buzz Lightyear is the same as well.I never miss Disney when I come to Hong Kong, but just be prepared this is not as big nor grand as any other Disneyland.",0
36776,"If you've never been to the real disneyland then you'll probably have a great time here,however,if you've seen the real thing then this will be a disappointment .its smaller,no characters,expensive and just not as good as the others.no Disney Magic I'm afraid.",0
9033,"Super compact, it's a very small park with only a handful of rides. Definitely excited to see the rest of the park open up. Ride the RC Car, it's goof!",0
36774,I didn't have high expectations for Euro Disney but did expect that the park would have the same standards as the US Disney destinations. I was shocked at how filthy the bathrooms were and how rude the 'cast members' were to the visitors. One of the cast members actually yelled at a visitor who didn't get on the ride quickly or efficiently enough for her. I would have let that go but it happened on 2 other rides with other cast members. There isn't a lot to do at the park but there were a lot of restaurants that weren't open. The ones that were open the food was not good at all. The train ride out was nice but I wouldn't waste a day in Paris by going there again.,0
29934,"It was our first time visit of disneyland. the decoration, the atmosphere and the characters seems to be you are in your fairytale. The roller coasters and machines with full entertainment BUT there are too many guests and you have to wait for everything. If you dont have fast pass, you have to wait minimum 40 60 min. for a single ride. If you want to eat something you have to wait, if you want to shop yes you have to wait! You can not take a photo with your favorite character because there are huge lines and characters are not there everytime.You can check the line times from the applications but because of the crowd you got exhausted.But the prade show and end show is hilarious.Not for adults: if you do not like children please think again for disneyland :)they are everwher with screams:)",0
4037,this was our 3rd time and went there to check the new attractions. the day was almost enjoyable until we had our lunch at Clopins festival of foods   particularly this lady and guy manning the centre portion of the fast food. THEY WERE SO RUDE! Now am not surprised why this place is loosing to Ocean park its because of these types of people with ill manners and bigots! Disney needs to call their attention and have them re trained to be customer oriented.,0
15780,"My previous review stands but with one major critique... I don't know why but Disneyland feels so much more crowded than it used to be. It's cramped. There's not enough room to walk around or sit; not enough room to take photos, you are always being jammed up by people with strollers and there isn't parking for the strollers when those people go in the rides. The walkways just weren't built or the traffic they currently receive. Until they limit the amount of tickets allowed to be redeemed daily or drastically change their pathways, this will remain cramped. I've been in the high season of Christmas time and now the low time of the post spring break and before summer break crowds and it is crowded no matter when, weekday or weekend.Previous review: Absolutely magnificent   the grounds are well maintained, the staff is friendly and it is fun for all ages. Obviously you're paying top dollar for this, but it's a fun treat for a vacation. Disneyland is MUCH smaller than Disneyworld, so you could reasonably do the majority of Disneyland in one weekend.",0
21959,"I brought my (3) kids (8,6,4) to Disneyland over spring break in late March 2014. I hated it. The kids hated it. The lines were 75  minutes per each ride (we rode 4 rides in 2 days). It was TOO crowded. Disney needs to limit the amount of people they let in each day. Kids and parents will not wait in lines that long. I am a well traveled mom and I did not see (1) happy parent and I saw a lot of people. It was not fun. Also if you have (3) kids under 14 here is the rule:(2) kids under the age of 14 cannot ride together on ANY RIDE.So 1 rode the rides with my 4 year old son. My 2 daughters could not ride together, so I had to ask strangers in line (who were older then 14) to ride with my daughters. It was awful!!! I will NEVER go to Disneyland again and my kids never want to go back.",0
6671,"honestly... i didn't like it much. I have been to disney land in orlando and does not compare even 50% to it. the parade was not as thrilling as the one in America. I did not enjoy it much but for disney park first timers, they might enjoy it.",0
36768,"decided to book thought Thomas Cook as taking the grandchildren for 3 nights 4 days. I had checked all the prices for trains etc and decided on the plane. glad we did. this was a good choice as we were collected from the airport and taken to the hotel. Cost   400 for flights for 2 adults and 2 kids age 6 and 4.Hotelcost   400 ish for half board. food wasnt great. salad bar not very inventive. and the main meals were ver poor. breakfast was continental style and if you wanted a cooked breakfast you had to lay out another 4 euro each. I paid for an omlette and beans for the grandson as he doesnt eat bread which is a real issue. but it was swimming in fat and he wouldnt eat it. the room. nice no issues.. clean etc. the kids had bunk beds and were really comfy. our bed was dredfull. was like two camp beds put together with a mattress on top so therefore a dip and ridge effect kettle in the room was a bonus and a hairdrier in the bathroom.. nice shower and bathif your self cat ering.. there is NOT a single shop anywehre in the vacinity and you would need to catch a train to the next town. we wanted to buy coffee as it was costing us 6euro for two smal cups, but no where to buy it. all hotels are around 15 20 minutes on the shuttle bus to disney land. and the busses go regulalry all day.had to pay another 540 euro for two days park entry.. so were now on   1500 for 3 nights. day one was spent queuing for 2 hours to see a princess and 1.5 hours to see mickey mouse. i expected to see charactors walking around.. nope.. not one. the kids were so dissapointed and i honestly wondered what the hell i had wasted   500 on! feel really ripped off. fish n chips (spot the fish) and fish finger and chips for the kids another   50 a time. everything is quadruple the price you wil pay in a disney store at home. we did the roudn the world boat which was good and the parade was good too. the paddle steamer was 15 minutes that i will never get back and apart from an old farmer (model) rocking in a wheelchair that was all there was to that. the kids kept asking to go back to the hotel to go swimming or in the play area (soft play)we met a family on the last day who told us that for our age group of kids they would have enjoyed the Disney odeon..but you do need a third day.Do not buy your tickets from the actual Disney land as we did!! we should not have paid for Harry as he is actually not 4 until march. so should have been free but they dont ask you for ages they simply charge you and i didnt ask.also the hotel were doing days for the price of 2 and we didnt realise that. also. on your tickets you are entitled to FREE PRIORITY PASSES.. no one actually tells you anything. and we need not have queued all the time.........would i return? i honestly dont think so.. its a lot of walking. a lot of money and altogether cost 2k which would better have been spent on an all incluisve holliday somewhere hot !i was so dissapointed with the place. i really wanted and expected for my grandchildren to see fairies and charactors that they know and love. but apart from the parade there was nothingnot for me",0

36765,"My children aged 9 and 6 enjoyed it! They did get sick of waiting for an hour to get on a very short ride. Then to Wye for another hour for something else. My daughter had to stand inline for three and a half hours to meet one princes for two minutes. Then was told to que again to see another even though she might end up with the same one.Forget extra disney hours if your in a disney hotel they only open six rides in the main park and the studios is closed until 10. So que, que, que as everyone tries to go early. They open the bigger, most popular rides at ten, people que for the other lands to open then run pushing as shoving to get in the que for the ride. Quite a few rides were closed for future enjoyment!!! The parade at half five was good although very busy, but created a happy atmosphere. Fireworks lasers at 8 was good too.No characters wondering around, que for a pic or autograph, don't eat at cafe del oro, absolute rubbish. The buffets or just outside the park was best. Food vouchers save you money, coke 5 euro, so take drinks, water fountains   didn't come across one that worked. The place itself is well kept but it's a ripoff they could have 5 cinereallas walking around in different areas rather than hidden inside the pavilion. Staff were the most miserable, clearly in the wrong job, bar one man who looked like Robin Hood he was chatty and helpful. Wouldn't bother going again.",0

21963,"Traveling from out of town, Disneyland is not a cheap venture. Slightly frustrating but the kids loved it.Keep in mind a few things, park hopper tickets are $150 per person, food is terrible and terribly expensive, none of the carts will give you water, rides are breaking down randomly and frequently. Does the cost of just getting into the park justify the experience... Just barely. Bring your own food and understand that the math is not in your favor. I.e. I drove from Arizona with my family of 4 and didn't have to pay for a hotel, in conclusion (and being very frugal) we rode 15 rides, dived that by the cost of everything (gas, tickets, parking, food, very little souvenirs) the total expense per ride was $42 a pop. Ya... Sink that thought In after you ride mr toads wild adventure.. The breaking point for me was, we were directed to park in the  lot  this is not the garage were there are trams to take you back and fourth. At the end of the night, we had 2 sleeping children in our arms walking all the way through down town Disney to finally reach our car and it (I kid you not) took an hour to get out...I can not wait for my kids to be of magic mountain age..

36761,"We attended disneyland for 4 days. We stayed at cheyanne hotel with half board.. first of all hotel was good .set as a wild west theme.the rooms were small and very basic but we didnt mind that.. half board consists with few cereals and rolls with ham,no hot food . Was sick of eating same crap each morning. The shuttle bus from hotel is great and comes every 5 10 mins.disneyland itself is nice the kid loved it. As for parents it has to be one of the dearest places in the world. Absolute disgraceful prices, a total rip off. The found is disgusting in every restaurant, the drinks very dear and are watered down . We had half board but there was not much selection, all was cheapy buffet found. And the worst part about disneyland is the waiting times. Queing for 2 and a half hours to go on a ride for 40 seconds is madness. Another 2 hours to see a princess which last for a minute. No matter what you want to do in disneyland, prepare to que a minimum of 2 hours, the restaurant ques are not much better. You spend most your day queing which really turned me off going here again. My child liked it but we couldnt enjoy it as the queing took its toll and we stopped . We wont be returning to disneyland paris again. Was certainly not worth the money. Absolute Rip off ",0
29939,"We visited Disneyland Park Paris as a part of the itinerary of the Veena World Group Tour. To be frank   we were disappointed and felt that a day was wasted   and wished we could have seen better French Heritage Cultural Attractions or spent the day exploring the streets of Paris. It is a huge American Style Amusement Park (wonder why it is located in France) and there are plenty of rides and displays. However   there was a huge rush and long queues everywhere   for the rides, for food, for the displays   so most of our time was wasted standing in queues. Some of the displays are impressive but the long queues dampen one's spirit. From our experience of  customer service    it seems they take visitors for granted. Disneyland Park is located quite a distance from Paris and is quite huge in size so it requires an entire day to visit and see the amusement park. If you have children   it may be worth a visit   otherwise   the day can be spent better visiting other iconic heritage attractions in Paris or spending the day imbibing the culture of Paris exploring the streets and enjoying local food and drink in the lovely Al Fresco Cafes.

15772,"This is the first time we've ever tried to go to Disney on a weekend and it will absolutely be the last. We were there on Sunday, April 10 and the crowds were simply unbelievable to us. We avoid holidays and summer and spring break and three day weekends and graduation season. How bad could a random Sunday in early April be, right? Wrong. It was so bad my husband will never go back. My daughter and I will go again once the bad memories fade but it sure as heck won't be on a weekend. In spite of all that, it's still Disneyland and I still love it and by Tuesday, the crowd levels were bearable and we had a nice day.",0
29942,"The whole resort is looking it   s age (25years) and needs updating, overhauling and needs to ensure it remains a place to visit. Long queues at peak season are inevitable but two major rides were closed resulting in long queues at every ride and even the ticket office only opened three booths resulting in long lines before you even get in! The restaurants offer the same fare of fast food. Come on Disney wake up! Offer more choice and keep the prices reasonable.    16 for one rib, one sausage and a small piece of chicken with 17 chips adds up for six of us! But the choice is always limited to hotdogs, burgers, wings and fries! Why?? (A sign the management are happy with their avaricious style and not listening to what the other public need and want). A small bottle of water is    3.19. Frankly disgraceful. Overall the rides are past their sell by date with our 8 year old , asking who? What? Never heard of it! Would we go again? No. I suggest saving and going to Florida. It   s worn better. It   s cleaner and you don   t feel that you are getting ripped off. The parade was worth staying for though",0
15770,"After saving and spending a lot of money and over 13 hours of flying to get to Disneyland from Australia I had two very excited boys who couldn't wait to explore Disneyland.How very disappointed they were. The crowds were so massive that you couldn't move around the park easily, all the rides had waits of over 1 hour (some even had 2 3 hour waits)Was extremely disappointing and we will never visit again now, nor recommend it to others.",0
29960,"This was the least favourite park of the two   mainly due to the ridiculous thing of having to book to see the characters!! This would be ok if they had lots of slots but four days in a row we sat on the app waiting for the booking to open, open and boom   full. When we spoke to staff they said they only release about 75 slots, well when there are thousands of people there is next to no chance of getting one! Very disappointing. Why not dot the characters around and if people want to see them they will queue like at the other park. Food was way overpriced, four hot dogs cost 60euros. Queues for the smaller rides weren't too bad, worth getting the fast passes but check they are valid for the rides you want as some aren't! Also download the app as it gives you the wait time for all rides.",0
36717,Me and my fiance went here and was very excited to.go. Got a good.deal on tickets to go to both parks for 100 pound. Great :) did studios first. Was ok. A lot.of 'how we do it' stuff which is fair enough. Went to the park and was disappointed. Was good enough but expected more rides. Didn't see any characters part from queuing to see mickey for a photo or when watching the parade which was awesome. Stayed for the end of day show and that's phenomenal. The rides weren't great but guess they are aimed at kids instead of 20's adults. Would go Again with kids ,0
12351,"Numerous problems with Disneyland Park in California.Pros:1. Fireworks show is good....thats the only positiveCons: 1. Parks are dangerously overcrowded2. 40 min que just to get into customer relations due to a problem with one of our tickets3. Lack of adequate signs for the main exit, fast past distribution signs lacking and why put fast past distribution away from the ride entrance area?...lots of people asking where ride fast pass booths were....if people have to ask then maybe put better signs up!. Some rides have fastpass lines split into 2 without any signs......heres an idea..put some signs up!4. No fans...in 96 degrees ques. Florida gas lots of fans on for the ques so why none at disneyland?...lack of shade in que lines.5. Numerous ride breakdowns. Toy story mania broke down and it was like it was all the staffs 1st day, they were useless and the tannoy was by an inaudible member of staff.6. No please or thank you by staff serving at the food carts....manners cost nothing.7. 2 days at the parks and no sign of mickey or minnie mouse!!....really poor.8. Price of souvenirs and parking higher than florida.9. Lines to get into the park, through bag check and onto trams way too long.10. Three large construction cranes in plain view in disneyland....you will need to edit them out of any pictures.11. Castle is tiny compared to florida12. Distinct lack of shows compared to florida13. Happiest place on earth?. Really.....many many miserable staff, fed up customers.First and most definetly last ever disney trip.",0
36674,"We did have nice weather, but you do need three or more days to do the park what got us the most was that the best rides were not working one ride we went back four times and it was not working one ride we got there 30 minutes before it opened to be told it was not working come back later. I think if you went for just a day you would be lucky to get more that four rides I could go on but the best thing was the fast pass but again you can only get one at a time you have to use it before you get another one and security coming in on Saturday to the park was over 100 metres long and that was just to get into the park you then had to get into a queue to get into the rides",0

If you have teenagers, i'd say over the age of ten, there may be 3 rides they'll really enjoy. There are many rides for small children though. The park is very small compared to the others. There are some good food stands and restaurants in the park. It is pretty well put together, and Main St. is amazing as in the other parks. Fireworks were great. I woud go on a monday or something, and off season is better as holidays and peak season its very busy. I would recommend this park for smaller children, but not nesecarilly for older kids.",0
36669,Imy wife and I took our daughter and three children 9 13 15 to Disney Workd before Easter.I recon that 90% of the tome is spent in queuing and 10% using the rides one had paid for.A three day pass for 3 adults and 3 children cost     840.00. Do not order a glass of wine at the Bistro restaurant. I recon their glass is 10.cls That's aroubd 9 glasses to a bottle that cost trade aroubd    5 .00 but the consumer pays     10.00 a glass This equates to     85.00 profit on every bottle sold. Greed. Comes to my mind. Our hotel exchange rate was    111.00 yo the UK pound. When even banks were giving     136.00 to the UK pound.Sadly greed takes over when mass tourism takes over.Baddbottle,0

36671,"7th and worst visit. Went there March 2015 and this was by far the worst trip we've had. Three of the biggest rides were shut down. The queues were really bad as a result of this. Some of the waiting times were up to 70 minutes! How do they expect people to stand there for this amount of time? The first day we got there, The Phantom Manor, Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Thunder Mesa, Crushes Coaster and Pirates of the Carribean were all closed! They may as well shut the entire park! No apologies were ever forthcoming. This is typical of Disney's attitude towards customers. If they are losing money, they've only got themselves to blame.",0
22020,"Having visited disneyworld Florida many times we were expecting a great couple of days, we were to be very disappointed. We were redirected to a car park at the outer edge of downtown disney and basically left to find our own way to the park which was a extremely long walk. The fact that disney knew we were being redirected as they were waiting ready to take the $16 parking fee they should have laid transport on to the park. The park was chaos, we put a fast pass in and it came up for 6 hours later so stopped us from using it again. I asked a assistant in one of the shops about a item and she said she would find out and then just left me. Splash Mountain was shut all day. Basically they just let to many people into the park on both days we went. It's expensive and we expected better",0
7876,We decided to visit Disneyland having a spare day. Very easy to get there on the train. Overall experience of the park was pretty disappointing. We have visited Disneyworld and Disneyland Paris and enjoyed both but this park was a let down. I'm sure there's better things to do in Hong Kong for the same price or cheaper. Wouldn't recommend this. ,0

33101,90 euros a person to get in for one day (two parcs) which is bad enough. Upon entering the parc we discovered that most of the main attractions ie rides were closed it seemed the only places open along with the minor rides and attractions were either shops or restaraunts. With so many parts of both parcs closed there should have been notification before shelling out all that cash plus 20 euros just to park the car and or a reduced entry price to reflect the diminished state of the parcs,0

Australia, thinking  Disneyland Hong Kong  should be something pretty spectacular.We were unfortunately let down.Bought a two day pass thinking it could take up to two days to Suss it all out, but we were finished by the end of the first day so never returned.The park is pretty standard, however the rude nationals of Hong Kong constantly pushing in line gets more then annoying, and by the end you start pushing back. More then irritating. !!!All of the food courts are crowded and near impossible to find a seat.If I was to return to HK, I definitely would not return to Disneyland, nor would recommend others to visit. There are better attractions to spend your time and money on.",0
29976,"We took three young kids here for a day out, and while the kids loved it, 80% of the adults we saw in queues looked dead in the eyes and were probably hoping for the sweet release of death as they waited for 40, 50, 60...90 minutes for a ride which lasted at most 10 minutes. The other thing that baffles me is that when the park opens at 10am, there are virtually no cafes open inside: I had to queue for 55 minutes for a couple of doughnuts, a muffin, and some warmish brown liquid (supposedly coffee). A piece of advice: bring as much of your own food and especially drink as you can, because a small bottle of water or coke (etc.) costs    3!Also: forget about wifi or mobile phone reception     how the hell Disney managed to build park near one of Europe's largest capitals where both are merely a tantalising joke beats me (also, this means forget about using their app and grab a park map at the entrance).",0
36681,"We stayed at the hotel Cheyenne and I cannot fault it. Breakfast was continental as expected and there was always plenty there. No kettle in the room but we took our own as its something like    30 to hire one. The free safe was fantastic!Now onto the parks......Disneyland was a bit of a disappointment with 5 rides out of action! We went in 2008 and the characters used to just pop up and you would get a photo and an autograph.......not any more! You have to queue for the same limited characters everyday......2 hours for Mickey and Minnie and a further 2 hours for rapunzel. If you want to see the princesses it was either a 3 hour queue on the Saturday or you had to make a reservation, which was impossible and was fully booked as soon as they were available. We had 5 character signatures in 5 days not impressed. On our last day we went eat at the buzz lightyear pizza planet.......my daughter was really poorly and asleep in a pushchair yet they refused to let the pushchair in which meant I would of had to wake her up. She didn't want to eat anything but because I wouldn't pay for her to eat nothing they refused to let us in to eat.....if I was to pay for her to eat nothing then we could go and eat so we walked away!!! Absolutely disgusting from a family theme park that make a ridiculous amount of money!!! We spent most of our time in the Disney studios far better rides and lower wait times! We did the half board plus meal plan fantastic value for money and I would highly recommend you book meal package before you go.....we saved about   200.The laser light and fireworks display at the end of everyday at the Disney castle is spectacular and if there's one thing you see whilst there that's it!!!! Overall a good trip the kids enjoyed it but we were very disappointed with how it has changed over the years.....not what they advertise on the tv!!!",0

In the words of Walt Disney,  Give them nothing, take from them everything! This is Sparta! I mean, this is Hong Kong Disney!  While we're at it, let's make sure that staff members don't ever smile! Also make sure they never greet you or farewell you in any store or ride or attraction! p.s. bring your own water because it's so humid you'll need about 3 to 4 bottles for the day and they cost $5 AUD per bottle!

However, after 20 30 mins of waiting in long lines for a ride, it was a great disappointment to see the folks ahead turning around and exiting past you only to say the ride is broken! This happened at least 3 times in one day and at no time did any Disney official announce the closing of the ride or offer an explanation or compensation. Even though the fireworks and Fantasmic were amazing and rate 5 stars, considering the fee to enter the park, the poor state of repair of the rides and total disregard for the customer, Disneyland Park only earns 3 stars.",0
36663,"By no means had a terrible time, but given the huge expense I was shocked by how lacklustre the place was. Very few rides (without queues it would be easy to do them all within a day), rudimentary service, and appalling 80s motorway service station levels of catering   at huge prices. They have been handed a great heritage, but a lack of investment means all the lovley if kitsch buildings and classic rides feel tired. Ratatouille aside, there is no use of 3D or any sense that things have moved on from 1992. Almost every building is given over to retail outlets rather than rides. Stayed in the Disneyland hotel at the main gates   great venue, but service was like that of an airport hotel. not right at prices comparable with the Ritz. Overall, it felt like the place was either debt ridden or greedy, and the customers were people to be exploited. Staff all seemed to have the Gallic disdain for American culture which meant no matter how hard they tried they hated being there. If you can't avoid a trip to Disney, then go to the US   bigger parks,probably better service and food (shocking to say about a place in France   but you can't get French food, even a baguette, there). Avoid. The likes of Peppa Pig World are cheaper and shockingly not so far behind.",0
4118,"If you are American or travel to the US often, skip the trip out to HK Disneyland. It's the exact same thing with literally only 5 10 products that are unique to Hing Kong and those are mostly key chains and t shirts. Just nothing special for a 45 minute train ride out of town",0
36661,"We have just spent 1 day in disneyland park, Paris. We are a family of 2 adults, a 9 year od girl and a 7 year old girl. We stayed in Paris and got the the train out to Disney which is very simple on the rer a line. Takes roughly 30 40 mins depending on where you get on in Paris.Once there my first issue was that as it was a weekend day I thought I had to buy a m  gic ticket rather than a mini ticket. I then thought Iwas entitled to extended opening hours but I was sadly wrong. I couldn't get in until 9.30 and even if you go in then you can't actually access the rides until 10 unless you are staying in a Disney hotel or have an annual pass so word of warning make sure you know what time you can get in fromAfter 10am things improved. The weather was a little rainy and generally we went on most rides if a max of 30mins queue on big thunder mountain but everything else generally less than 15mins. I was pleasantly s  rprised expecting queues to bores. The fast pass system for tickets is recommended. Try to use it if you can. We h  d snacks in our rucksack but had lunch in a Mexican place, Fuentes orca which was pretty good food. 12 euro per adult and less per ki including puddingand a drink.Better quality food than you'd get in an English theme park I think.All in all an enjoyable day but not amazing. I think the Age of your child hugely influen  es things. My girls aren't nt   princesses and not bothered about meeting them and getting autographs soi can't comment on the process of doing that. I can't say the rides are very exciting for older kids. 5 rides were closed on he day we visited and so the only roller coasters were thundr montain and Indiana jones. Neither particularly scary or Long.We did enjoy our day but think we were lucky with queues. I don't feel I need to visit aGain for a longtime but is worth doing for and off and the Disney parade at 5.30 was great fn with all the Disney characters on different floats",0

The only saving grace is the fact we had such a good deacon the price that I didn't feel too ripped off.Some of the rides were being refurbished, understandable as they have to be done at some point I suppose.For the 3 days we visited the studios the ratatouille ride was constantly out of order, not so good for a new ride! Needless to say we were very disappointed as the new rides were one of the main reasons for returning. There seemed to be a lack of characters circulating the parks this year. Instead they were at specific points with huge queues! And these were few and far between, as a result we had 3 pictures with characters in 5 days! 2 hours queueing for mining mouse on our last day left is wet and frustrated. As a result we left straight after to head home. No extra magic hours in the studios! Why?!? Again, disappointed as most of the older children rides were here hence why we came here more than the main park. We came to the conclusion that we have out grown disneyland paris. ",0

36652,"This is truly one of the worst theme parks I have ever visited. Firstly trying to get into the park there were long tail backs just to get in, the reason? All the credit card machines had gone down, so instead of just letting the cars park and taking the hit just to get people in they make every car scrabble around for cash. You only found this out when you get to the booth as the staff directing traffic are more bothered with getting people staying at the hotel in. Then after paying 15 Euros, yes really, to park we then line up to get your bags checked (not a problem, just have more staff on) Once in the park we realised that the whole parks credit card machines were down, but again you would only find this out once you got to the end of the line.But the worst thing was the amount of closed rides. Every high profile ride except the 'Runaway train' type ride was closed. Not just broken down, but covered and off. What the heck are we paying for, its defiantly not the happy atmosphere. Of the three, yes three, rides we did go one, two stopped mid ride ( one repeatedly ) and one looked like it had been there since the day it opened.The food is dire and beyond expensive.I know that this place is constantly on the verge of bankruptcy, but I didn't realise that they were trying to get their total debt back off me in one day.Avoid.",0
36651,"Please excuse if I seem overly critical but I'm trying to give a balanced view.We stayed at the resort on a Friday   Monday evening. The park itself is well maintained but like a few people have said their is a significant amount of maintenance happening. This is probably due to the influx of cash from Disney, I don   t know.Staff: In the park itself the staff where way more friendly than my last visit four years ago. They all seemed happier and far more approachable. This was let down by the people visiting the park. what shocked me was that adult were forcing their way to the front pushing young children so they get a good view. Correct me if I'm wrong but the whole magic of Disneyland is around kids, adult who prioritise themselves (over young children) to get a picture of a person in a costume is frankly quite sad. I don   t like to finger point but these were mainly of French nationality. As there is only one large parade per day (they need to do more) the parade get stupidly busy. Disney need to make a zone for children so they don't have to fight the adult. An incident occurred when the security force peopled off some grass mounds (as there was no room on the paths) due safety reasons, but it was okay for people to stand on metal gates and bins to get a view. I'm sorry this was rubbish all they wanted was the preserve the grass and there were no safety issues as everyone was sitting down.TIP: Don't go at a weekend esp a Saturday as the parks are so busy.Queues: Even during the week they were beyond stupid. 60 80 minute queue. The family and i where fortunate enough to have VIP fast passes. I will never visit Disneyland Paris without these otherwise our trip would have been ruined. Even with magic hours the queues got too busy @ 930amCharacters: Basically if you don't get to the park @ 8am you face a horrific queue to see a character otherwise you have to go with a character dinner, breakfast or lunch. This is a sad state of affairs there isn't enough characters at Disneyland parks. And only if you are will to pay for the experience. Disney need to resolve this issue considering they have removed characters from the Disney resorts.On the positive side. The Dreams fireworks and evening parade where fantastic.

36715,"Having never been to a Disneyland before we were excited to go and kept it as a surprise treat for our 8 year old son on our last day of a trip to Paris.The first thing that hits you is how tacky everything is and in such a bad state of repair. Customer service generally could best be described as glum. Despite it not being school holiday time in France the place was rammed. We queued first of all for an hour and while approaching the front were told that the ride had to close for safety reasons.We caught sight of Mickey on a walk about and made our way over to the large crowd hoping to meet him. He was cordoned off by minders who barked orders at young children and their parents. Horrible. Waited patiently for another 45 mins or so to try and meet him but time ran out and he was off. Managed to get a photo of Mickey's back and my son smiling gamely in the foreground.The queues were building towards lunchtime so we thought we'd better try and get a place. The food offerings generally tended towards poor quality junk food at highly inflated prices. We stood in line for a further hour to get into a self service buffet type place. You pay up front on entering and extra for drinks.  Do you want a drink?  the harassed person on the till demanded. There is no menu and basically you have a choice between  soda , wine or beer. She then waved a curley Mickey straw in front of my son ... which was another 10 euros or so on top of the extortionately priced food. No thanks. We had already forked out 30 euros to kit the 3 of us out in rain jackets since it was tipping down and extra to stow our luggage ... while we were  enjoying the magic . We looked around for a table ourselves but were instructed to move to a smaller table laid for two once seated. We ordered drinks but after 20 minutes or so they still hadn't arrived. We asked a waiter who presumed we hadn't paid and wanted to see our receipt to prove it. Another queue for the ladies toilets (laughably inadequate for the size of restaurant) and we were out again for more  fun .Just under an hour to queue for the Buzz Lightyear ride which flashed by in a couple of minutes and it was time to head home.What a disappointment, it felt like the whole thing was an exercise in trying to extract the most amount of money for the least return. I am baffled by the good reviews ... you couldn't pay me to return. Save your money and go to Chessington on an inset day   it knocks spots off Disneyland Paris.",0

I have have traveled to the Orlando and California locations more times than I want to admit.But Disneyland was hot, with huge crowds, lines and crying kids. The Disney cast were as usual on top of their games.The park itself is small compared to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando and the castle seems rather small in comparison. It seems that they are renovating the park with a lot of construction on going so maybe my comments are unfair.I do like the Fastpass system to at least get you on a few rides that you may enjoy.The Light Parade is going in to retirement I heard, so if you are interested, get there before August 20. The fireworks and show are still incredible.I would love to visit again in a couple of years to see the park that they have re created.",0
21996,My family went here on early May and nearly half of the rides were closed for routine maintenance getting ready for the summer season. Not only was this disappointing for the kids and adults alike but there was no discount in the entry fee. As so many rides were closed the ones that were open were overcrowded with huge waiting times.,0
36712,"Where to start! Arrived in Eurodisney on the Friday afternoon for my granddaughters 3rd birthday, 5 of us. Stayed 2 nights in Hotel New York. We had booked 2 rooms both with 2 double beds but they gave us rooms with just 1 bed in each so that was the 1st problem. They did change them with no bother but it all took time. Once we had dumped our bags we headed straight out to the Disney studios as its smaller so we thought save the main park for the full day on Saturday. Totally unimpressed. Absolute chaos and so disorganised. My daughter & granddaughter queued up 4 an hour just to have a photo taken with Mickey Mouse, which is fine but not when you have older adults pushing in front to get their photo taken with him and the staff not saying anything to them! We were a bit peckish after this so went to one of the (not very) fast food places for a snack. What a mistake. Yet another queue because they 'forgot' our order. They were extremely slow serving everyone and it didn't look very hygienic, or safe, cleaning down the work tops with a mini pressure washer. The tea was like dishwater and they used hot milk in it! In fact every cup of tea I had was made with hot milk! Awful. Anyway we only went on 2 rides because of the disorganised queues. We had booked Cafe Mickey for the 1st night and that was brilliant purely for the fact that the characters walk round and let you take photos with your child, my granddaughter loved it especially Tigger and Goofy. They made her giggle uncontrollably by tickling her under her chin and making a fuss of her and not just the once either. The food wasn't at all bad, didn't feel rushed and the waiter was lovely. The next day (Saturday) we set out for the main park. My god, I've never seen so many people pushing and shoving to get through the entrance barriers! Some nationalities don't understand the concept of queueing. Atrocious behaviour from grown adults who couldn't give a fig about pushing toddlers and young children out of the way and the dismal land staff didn't help at all. The park was so busy we only went on a couple of rides and then we had to queue for ages. Some queues were advertising a 2 hour wait for rides and even queuing for a fast pass was up to an hour long! Went to Annette's Diner the 2nd night which was average for food and if you're on the plump side you wouldn't fit in the booths! The best bit was when the waiting staff burst into song and dance to Grease Lightning and encouraged diners to join in, great free floor show. Everything in the park is overly priced so take loads of money. One final thing, don't know if it's just me but I think there's something a little bit weird and sinister about grown adults hugging the Characters and getting their autographs! ",0
4083,"It's a good place to visit when you go to HK. I just went there for looked around, bought some souvenirs and see parade show of course. Unfortunately, it was rain on that day.",0
29963,"Not sure how to help other travellers as everyone   s experience will be different. If rides are your thing, I   d recommend going to PortAventura, if you want the Disney experience, go to Paris. It is an amazing place but my kids are probably just outside the ideal 'Disney' aged (10 13) and enjoyed 'Studios    more. Our trip was in high season, insanely hot, horrific queues, bigger rides shut for hours due to power outages, fast track system failed due to shut rides, lack of shade, park ran out of cold water to buy    and did I mention the queues?It   s big and sprawling (and expensive)   getting between from Disney to Studios takes 20  mins, getting to the bigger rides within each park about the same. When the parade is happening (and 20 mins before) you can   t get from one side of Disney Park to the other, not all rides are open until closing time...Suggestions: Get the app, the waiting time for rides is useful. If it is hot, plan the day and get out of the heat for a while; go as early as possible, maximise 'magic hour' (if you are staying in a Disney Hotel) but be aware, rides opened later than advertised; expect long queues and be patient.The restaurant food was excellent.",0
4085,"Been to both Anaheim and Orlando, while the design is similar it just doesn't have the atmosphere or Magic of these parks. Barely any rides either. Maybe with small children I would visit again, but not by myself or with friends.",0
4086,"crowded place. food is expensive. if you wanna ride be prepared to wait for 30 45 min to be seated. so its time consuming to attempt to ride and see all attraction on a day. staff speaks minimal English. don't be shocked cause rudeness is rampant and common.you can bring bottled water inside and small crackers only. but if you are a Chinese national you can bring rice meal!!!!!! prejudice, bias and discrimination at its best!!!!",0
4087,this is not Disney Land it is Disney village... it is very small and not really much to see and do there.... it is really not worth your time or money.. IF it did not have the name Disney attached.. no one would go there.. Disney corporation itself should be ashamed to attach its name to this...Ocean Park is a much more fun and larger park.....go there instead....,0
36706,"Disappointed with NO characters walking around.  WE CAME 2 years ago and bumped into loads of characters who we could say hello to and get autographs from, but this time we did not see any.  3 days 6 autographs very disappointed",0
21998,"I get it, it's Disneyland and people are expected to pay a high price just to say they've been there. From the 5 buck Churro, the 10 buck corn dog that takes 30 min in line to the waffle corn ice cream on Main Street that takes another 30 min to get. If you have little ones who are impatient, I suggest going elsewhere. We used to have the annual passes and would come 3 times a week and the lines would be maybe 5 10 min max and have dinner at Napa Rose. Now it doesn't matter what day of the week, people are everywhere around Disneyland. My Kids hate Disneyland simply because the lines are so long and they can't even walk around without getting struck with a stroller. They are 5 and 6 and would rather go to Universal Studios or Legoland than come here. ",0
15746,"We went to Disneyland at the time of the school kid's holiday, so the park was VERY full and we had to wait in a very long queue under the sun for a looong time just to get into 1 ride. The ones I liked were Back to The Future, Indiana Jones and Space Mountains. Perhaps they are trying to cater to children more, so the rides were not thrilling for me. Some sites such as Pirates of the Caribbean was closed so that was a bummer. But the night parade did make up the exhaustion and disappointment that I had all day. Carefully designed and choreographed, the magic of Disney finally arrived at the night parade.",0
33097,"My experience in Disneyland was just fine. It's a must see do one time in the life. Well, I am 26 years old so not an aged person but I find Disneyland is mostly for small children aged below 15. The place is quite big, I suggest you bring a small backpack inside sufficient amount of food and drink which you will not need to pay so much money inside the parc because they steal your money with this and besides you don't loose time for these) while you are waiting, you can eat and drink whatsoever. Take extra T shirt or more if you are wet summer might be hot and comfortable shoes to run and walk fast :) Decide earlier what do you want in which park, because going from 1 to another can be losing time mostly! Bring camera to make these moments unforgettable :)1day is enough if you are not a big fun of all the Disneyworld. 2 day is better to get more fun that's for sure. Buzz Light Year Laser Blast,Phantom Manor,Ratatouille are ZERO!!! I didn't like them. If you want more excitement and adventure;RacerInd  ana Jones,Rock & roller coasterspace mountaintower of terror ( loved it ) Star toursIf you stay in Paris, get the tickets two way in a first place because there is a queue even for buying tickets RER.",0
36702,"Considering the price and expectations of visiting a Disney resort, Disneyland Paris really doesn't provide anymore. I've visited the park 6 times since it's opening in 1992 and have experienced a drop in characters roaming, decor and overall experience. On our visit we were lucky to interact with many fantastic cast members but found a lack of organisation around the Disneyland Park. 30 minutes to get through bag check at 11am ... Organised chaos, please hold onto your little ones and watch no one stamps on them. What happened to queuing systems. Another 30 minutes to check bags in and then we were off touring. Being trod on and pushed about. Oh and queue hoppers attempting to cut in.The whole park could do with a paint job and hopefully, now the Walt Disney Company have stepped in, money can be spent to create a Disneyland we all love. Also where were the characters and roaming photographers? The shops lacked variety and specialist objects. However I found prices quite good and the Photopass plus an excellent value (I was here on my hen weekend and wanted all the ride photos. It cost    49.99 and we ended up with 11 ride photos)The end of the night continued with organised chaos. We were staying at the Kyriad Disneyland Paris Hotel, the bus to get back to the hotel is a NIGHTMARE!!! People pushing children and adults out the way to get on, knocking small children over and again cutting to the front of the line. Where's the queuing systems and security? It is 100% an accident waiting to happen. It wouldn't cost too much to put up a queuing system. My advice here is keep your party together and either leave the park a good hour before Disney Dreams (which is one of the best shows I've ever seen) or late and take your time leaving the park. The way the park is at the moment I would recommending saving your hard earned money until you can visit Walt Disney World, Florida. A lot of work is needed to bring this park back to its former glory.",0
36700,"We have just returned from our first family trip to Eurodisney Disneyland Paris. I have tried to put together a note on issues, recommendations and otherwise to facilitate all future holiday planners when considering a trip to Disney Europe.Prior to our trip, I had talked to friends that had previously gone and the one comment was    I hope you have better luck queuing than us   . Not a totally positive message but always followed by    the kids enjoyed it   .We booked through El Corte Ingles and they were very helpful with the booking process while not having any specifics to share worth regard to the proposed experience, hence this critique. The booking options for a first timer are difficult to follow as you do not know what to expect. This is not a reflection on either the customer or the seller (Disney). It is a complex collection of options, hotels, price packages, etc.We were booked through Vueling from Terminal 4 in Madrid to Terminal 3 Charles de Gaulle Paris. The flight timings were as expected and overall the journey was well managed. I would point out that the connection to the VEA bus to bring us directly to Disneyland was a bit more complicated than expected. Once you read the small print on the booking form, it all made sense. First exit Terminal 3 Arrivals (a small terminal which Knock Airport in deepest Mayo would probably put to shame). Walk 300 meters to the right and arrive eventually at the train terminal. Look for signs marked CDGVAL and using this driverless train connection transfer to terminal 2. Look for Gate 8 and turn right until you arrive at the VEA Gate for transfer to Disneyland. There were two VEA representatives on route. We missed the first one as she was sitting in the background and not really paying much attention to arriving passengers. It was only after we net the second representative, who directly us nicely to the actual departure point ,that we realized who the first person was. The bus trip took about 45 minutes and the bus schedule was approximately one every hour. In order not to be hanging around for long periods it is worth following up on the actual bus schedules prior to arrival.With regard to hotel options, I can only go on first impressions as we passed through four on our way to our own hotel.     The first was the Newport Bay. This was an extremely large hotel that seems to be undergoing an extensive refurbishment to three quarter of the facility. I do not know the impact on the residents but it would have caused me concern on first sight.    The second was the Sequoia Lodge. This seemed a nice set up visually but I cannot comment more than that.    The third was the Santa Fe and first impression left me cold and I considered it extremely ugly especially with the big hoarding of Lightning McQueen over the entrance area. I was so glad we were not stopping there. Please read further to allay some of my first misgivings.    The last stop was the Cheyenne where we were staying. First impressions were very good and the visual impact of the small Western village look was very good.On entry to the hotel, a vision of mayhem unfurled. A long queue with no seeming purpose extended for a distance of maybe 30 metres. We were handed forms to fill out which covered details already provided in booking process. On arrival at the actual reception desk, extensive paperwork and tickets were provided but instructions were delivered by rote by the attendant and when asked specific questions she did not want to deviate from planned script. The use of the provided vouchers can be complicated as it is limited to a specific set of restaurants and also in the case of accompanying drinks (non alcoholic only) to a specific set depending on restaurant, i.e., if expecting to include milk for a baby bottle, be ready to be disappointed. The mid afternoon snack is a great idea but again limited to a doughnut or an ice cream (variety depending on the restaurant at which you order). I do not understand in this day and age why so much paper and laminated tickets had to be provided to avail of the facilities. Every morning we had to check we had the relevant vouchers for the day. Surely a simple magnetic coded card can simplify the whole process for both the supplier and the customer. The check in process took about an hour and a bit. I think that as part of that process they should also ask whether a Hair Dryer or Kettle will be required as otherwise you will have to queue again at the alternate reception to order and pay a deposit (25 euros for each item) for same. We were then informed that our room would not be ready until 3pm, we had arrived at 10.30am. If we had been aware of this we could have planned and or adjusted our travel accordingly.  Languages were catered for very well in our hotel (French, Spanish and English) and in the park generally. There were some restaurant staff would did not have language competencies but these were few and far between.We then had to book a lunch in the hotel (all meals required booking beforehand). This involved queuing again (maybe getting you prepared for the days ahead) for 45 minutes at the alternate reception desk.I have to recommend the luggage holding facilities as being very efficient and so useful on both arrival and departure days. The personnel were extremely friendly and helpful.There were no real children entertainment activities in the hotel proper. There was a games room but more aimed at teenagers rather than the younger ones which I believe the park is primarily aimed at. There were more kids entertainment options across the way in the Sante Fe but we did not know any of this at this stage.We had a bit of time to spare prior to lunch but the kids wanted a snack. We went to the hotel shop and bought a packet of crisp for something like    3.40. This was our first exposure to the Disney price markup. Take a regular price and add 50% markup. One useful tip for everybody staying in Disney hotel, go to the train station (on site) and buy your crisps and chocolate snacks for half the price from the station vending machines.We had our lunch in the hotel using the vouchers provided. The meals are all buffet style. The vouchers we had allowed access to a number of difference restaurants in the Disneyland complex, from other hotels e.g., Cantina in the Santa Fe, to ones situated in the park proper. The food quality was adequate without being exceptional. I reckon all the restaurants included in the options are using the same provision source as ALL the food is the same. The only exception is the Agrabar, which I would definitely recommend for adults (better service as well) but the food is a bit spicy (not in the hot sense) for children. You are provided with a limited set of options for your drinks. There is no Trina (non gas) option and, more importantly, if you want milk for a baby they will want to charge you for it (   2.60). Please see individual restaurant notes for exceptions to this policy. I cannot say the staff serving were that welcoming but rather were doing what they had to do.Once we got to our room, the first impression is of a dated nature to the facility driven more by the wear and tear of the rooms    entrance ways and the room itself. Nothing was dirty but it did show an accumulation of grime from age rather than anything else. That said, it was still clean and we had no issues.Now for the park proper. First day we set off and it is only a 15 minute walk to the village with another 15 minutes to the park. I messed up on the initial visit as I did not understand which tickets were meant for the parks. They were very good and gave us one off ticket replaces for that day. Again with a simple ticketing system, none of this would be necessary. We were very luck on our visit as we were there for five days and the first 3 had excellent weather. The park is a different prospect in cold or rainy weather.When planning your trip, you should really learn as much as you can of the rides available and how they suit the age profile of your kids. There can be much disappointment and wasteful days if you do not have a plan. If the weather is good, queuing is not so bad but if cold or wet prepare yourself for a horrible experience. The extra hours option that comes with staying in the complex hotels cannot be underestimated. The majority of our kids entertainment was done at this time. However, only an EXTREMELY limited set of attractions are open at this time and primarily for the 7 and under age group.Given the park is aimed at kids primarily (with the exception of maybe 3 rides) queuing with kids is probably the biggest drawback of the entire visit. There is nothing to do but wait and try and distract your children as best you can. On our last day, we visited the studios at 11.30am and our 6 year old wanted just Ratatouille and the Nemo rides. Both rides had 60 minute wait times so we queued for 20 minutes for a fastpass for Ratatouille before a rumour came back down the queue that none were left for that day. No obvious signage of such an issue was provided and I had to go to the head of the queue to enquire and get confirmation and this was so. A waste of 20 minutes of our lives.A significant portion of your queuing is done outdoors, so be prepared given the weather. Cold wet bored children do not make good companions.Lastly a curious note on our departure. We traveled as previously stated via Charles de Gaulle Terminal 3. In the caf   shops a bottle of Pepsi was    3.60. In the vending machine, within 20 metres of the shops, it was    2.20.",0
29973,"(1) Unlike the US Disney Parks, you can bring food here. Do it! Seriously, the food options in the park are limited to junk and very few restaurants cafes were open, even on a Saturday. On a Saturday, at 18:00, the large cafe by Space Mountain had two lines open... during dinner. Oh, one line was cash only and the other credit with no signs posted. (2) Prepare kids for disappointment temper expectations. This park    looks Disney great    but many rides were out of order. On August 18, Thunder Mountain closed from opening until 15:00. Pirates shut down after waiting an hour in line. Space Mountain, Tower of Terror were down for at least two hours. Haunted Mansion was closed. The Indiana Jones ride might actually be the worst ride I have ever gone on. Not exaggerating: There was nothing even close to relate it to Indiana Jones. It is a very painful coaster that circles around a poorly decorated temple. That   s it. There aren   t that many rides in the park, so you wonder what you are paying for.With that said, Pirates, Ratatouille, Crush, and Space Mountain all were great! Spend more time on those. (3) Be prepared for Richard Craniums who smoke vape throughout the park even though there are smoking areas and signs posted not to do so everywhere. Watching adults hide their cigs like they were 13 year olds in school is embarrassing. Btw: there are very few workers throughout the park itself. So, no one around to say anything to them.(4) If doing a day trip from Paris like we did, you   ll be getting up early and traveling at least an hour each way. Every day at a Disney day is exhausting, but this one was more so. My son and I only made it to about 18:00. My wife and two other kids were back to the hotel by 21:00. If I could do all over again, I might make this the last day of a trip, stay at a Disney hotel, and head directly to airport next day. In fairness, my kids had a lot of fun but all agreed without prompting that this park is nowhere close to what is in California or Orlando. As many people have said, there is less attention to quality and detail and seems more like a money grab. I will be back to Paris but this park. I will say though that every worker was very helpful, smiling, and went out of their way to enhance the stay. ",0
33098,"It is hard to rate a Disney park 2 stars. It may be harsh, but the expectations are different for Disney. They set their own bar and this park falls short. The biggest issue is half the park is under repair. No Thunder Mountain, no Small World, no Star Tours, no Alice. Then some of the rides need help. Space Mountain has ripped seats and is obviously in need of a face lift. The Indiana Jones ride may break someone's neck if they don't get it updated. The kids had fun, but it is not living up to the Disney name. ",0
29966,"I love Disney but I was a bit disappointed by Disneyland Paris for a few reasons. 1. Staff grumpy. 2. Food Drink absolutely extortionate!!! 3. Queue for at least 1 1.30hr for each ride. I wouldn   t mind the food being expensive if it was good food, reasonable portion size but it was neither of those things. Regarding the queues, families have paid a lot of money to visit Disney and spend their time queuing for hours! I feel like in this instance the Disney name and price is being used but not the quality that normally goes with it ;( Aside for the above we had a lovely family time at the park. The parade floats really were wonderful and any child adores meeting Micky....even if you have to queue for 75 minutes to see him! ",0
36697,"Oh dear, what have French managed to do to the magic of Disney? Firstly we love Disney so this is not a Disney knocking review and like a number of reviewers I would whole heartedly agree every child should get to visit Disney. Unfortunately, from the jewel of Europe in the 1990's Disney has sunk to an all time low with shops having very little merchandise, paint peeling from walls, no organisation at the main gate or bus station creating major risk to small children getting crushed in the push for both entrance and exit. However, they have maintained their high prices (Florida is also expensive don't let anyone tell you different) Back in the 1980's France was chosen and immediately the fears started to grow, these have now come home to roost, the staff now treat guests with distain and three of the main rides closed at the same time is poor planning on a park where there are so few rides anyway. The lack of shows to shelter from the winter weather is a major failure on the planners and the total lack of characters around the park embarrassing. Yes America is better, weather, size, etc but the big difference are the staff members who look like they are not serving a prison sentence. This is my fifth and final visit to Disney and Paris, what it had, it has lost. The most appalling part is having enter the park and then exit the park again to place your luggage in holding. On a positive note, the firework display out paced Florida and the castle is still the most beautiful of all the Disney parks. Get your paint brush out Walt. ",0
36696,"The Bad:The entire park could use a good cleaning. Gum residue all over. Paint worn away all the way down to the metal on many hand rails. Liter everywhere. As a Disney FREAK, I was very disappointed.The Good:Short lines. Almost all lines were below 15 minutes. Imagineering (the reason we go to Disney) was nice, with a few attractions that are not at Disney World Orlando.TVR station (bullet train) right at the entrance to the park was quite nice, but the price was not. Ten minute ride from airport, but was 29euros per passenger.",0
4094,"Went there and it was SLIGHTLY drizzling. It was signal number 3 (this was posted but no further details or notes added). Upon paying and entering we found out that NO outdoor rides would open that they and at around 12NN they announced that the fireworks is cancelled. We went home at around 1PM and saw that the line was still long at the entrance, the customers had no idea that Disneyland rides were not to be used that day.A sign outside along the signal number 3 should have been put. What a waste of HK549 and HK109 (food). I went to HK for this.",0
29967,"The kids enjoyed it in this parc, the atmosphere is amazing. However, I would not consider going again in August. It is simply too busy. Queues for each ride were over an hour and you even had to find a spot at least 30 minutes before the parade begins to get close to seeing anything. We did get fast pass tickets for a few rides but the timings between them meant we could only manage two a day.There were only a few characters to get autographs from in the parc with very long lines.At lunch time we stopped to get hotdogs & chips which cost 60 euros for five of us!You are also charged 25 euros per day for parking!Over all we did have a nice day, but the queues were frustrating and boring for the kids.",0
22004,"We had a 3 day pass for Disneyland and our visit was planned for the week after Spring break to make sure that we avoided the crowds. I have visited Disneyland twice before, once 25 years ago and then again with my husband 7 years ago so I certainly have something to compare this visit with. My husband and I had a two day pass 7 days ago and we got around all of the rides on the first day and went back the 2nd day to ride the ones that we really loved another time or two. One of the rides that we loved was Space Mountain with its fast rollercoaster and scenery of the Universe. I think we did it 3 times back then. Well...those days are over.The crowds are so dense right from the long wait first thing in the morning as you queue to get your bags checked and then queue again to get your ticket checked. Took us over an hour to get in the gate and the same thing happened on the Magic morning pass   queuing for over an hour just to get in and this is supposed to be a quieter time! Once in, more crowds, so dense that walking along the pathways is reduced to the speed of the crowd. Strollers and buggies clog up the walkways as we tried to navigate between them to get our fastpasses. We managed two Fastpasses on the first day but the third one required us to return 5 hours later in order to use it and the standard queues at the rides had reached around 1 1 2 hours standing time so on the first day we only tried out 3 rides and gave up in the end.The next day, even with the magic morning pass, the queue for the Matterhorn Bobsleds was over an hour once we got off our first ride and the queue for The Cars ride was an hour and a half. I don't know what happened to the Space Mountain ride since the last time we were on it but we had the initial Warp type laser set up and then we were in pitch black for the whole of the 3 minute rollercoaster ride...what a fizzer. On the third day we decided that we would head straight for the Indiana Jones ride that had been closed for maintenance for a couple of weeks and had opened again the day before. We grabbed a Fast Pass but it still took around 35 minutes of queuing to get on the ride. The other main queue for this ride was sitting around an hour and a half. Once on the ride it was all fun and games until about three quarters of the way through when it broke down and we sat in the jeeps for about 10 minutes while they tried to fix it. No good though so the ride was closed down and the huge long queue of people waiting all had to reverse direction and head back out....what a waste of their time! Trying to get between parks to book Fast Passes and then return for the rides became so onerous and exhausting with the packed throughways that we gave up and left Disneyland without having been on all of the rides and well and truly over the place. We would not recommend it to anyone even after having done so for years and we would certainly not go back.Disney Management needs to take a serious look at the number of people that they pack through into the parks now and set some limits in order to enable people to be able to enjoy the rides without having the long queue times. Ridiculous to have to queue for 1 hour   1 1 2 hours for a 3 minute ride which basically means queuing the whole time you are there to enjoy about 20   30 minutes of rides in total for a day. Maximum numbers need to be set and then more people allowed in only once some have left. That, or find a way to shorten the wait times for the queues for the rides while reducing the packed and crowded thoroughfares.",0
33099,"Not as big as the Disney in LA or Orlando. DL Paris is very small. Only four lands. Park can be done in a day. Didn't have much in way of adult rides, but rides that cater to children. Indiana Jones ride was closed. Star Tours was under renovation. That only left Small World, Phantom Manor (which broke down), Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, & Buz Lightyear. We were there for the Disneyland Half Marathon and purchased a three day pass. We only used two days of our pass. The fireworks show in front of the castle is worth watching. We only saw characters on Saturday from the window of the Disneyland Hotel. No other characters could be seen walking the park. I came, I saw, won't be going back.",0
25961,"I guess you might say that Disneyland is a little more on the overrated side but if you were ever a kid and wanted to go it's a must. Make sure you grab the fast pass (costs a bit more) so you can pass by the huge lines. The drinks and food is of course over priced. If you buy any souvenirs they're super pricey so buying outside of the park will save you a lot. If you plan on going in the fall or early spring expect to find a lot of things closed for maintenance especially in Adventureland side. I've been to Disneyland twice now and it never fails to be super busy regardless of the time of the year. However, the lines aren't too bad to get into it that time of year.There's not a ton of rides for adults but there is a lot of things to look at. I was kind to find how Mickey Mouse snobbed people from pictures. Families would go chasing after him to try to get one. They try to get most people to get pictures inside a booth so they can sell you the pics. As if it wasn't enough for the $80  entrance fee to get in.If you're an adult you really only need one day to go through it but if you're with kids I'd imagine one to three days would be more than enough to try just about every attraction. It really all depends on the age of your kid. There's definitely some cool roller coasters worth trying so even if you're an adult don't pass it by. If you're going to grab a hotel there's tons of really reasonably priced ones within a block of the Disneyland entrance. There's plenty of restaurants around so if you want to save there eat at one before going in as inside they'll definitely get your wallet.",0

29970,"After spending over $500 to get into the place we then had the pleasure of lining up in lines for a minimum of 45 mins in 35 degrees Celsius heat.  Don't waste your time, horrific day.",0
29971,"The park is okay, very crowded so not great for young children. You have to wait in line to see characters and some of them you have to book in advance. Toilets are not clearly sign posted so sometimes difficult to find. The rides are good though when you actually get on them.",0
29972,"We (parents, 10 year old boy and 5 year old girl) went on a Friday in mid August hoping it would be a bit less crowded than the weekend. However the park was packed full of people. It was way overcrowded and obvious that the park wasn't designed for such a huge amount of people.Everywhere you went it was packed. Not just in the queues for the rides, but EVERYWHERE.The queues at the rides where endless. The least attractive rides where at least 45 minutes. The highlight rides where 90 minutes .We got our first fastpass at15:00 and it was for 20:40 21:00   in 6 hours time!!. We could get our next fastpasses at 17:00 but all of the fastpasses have run out from about 16:15. There were no fastpasses left almost 7 hours before the park closed!Even if you started really early with the fastpasses you could at best get 2 or 3 during the day. Very far from the 6 that they make you believe you could get.We spent about 5 hours doing 4 rides and the sheer amount of waiting in line was just exhausting. We could see parents and children all around us with looks of despair in the eyes. We then went to grab a bite and waited over 50 minutes in line to get  fast  food and then had no place to sit. All around us were families sitting on the side along the streets trying to eat and rest. It looked like a refugee camp.At around 18:00 we went by the Indiana Jones ride and the wait was 90 minutes. I asked my son if he wanted to go on it and I would wait in line with him. He got tears in his eyes and said no, he just couldn't bear to think he would need to stand in line an hour and a half for a 2 minute ride. At that point we decided that put and end to our misery and just left. We didn't even get to use the only fastpass we had for later that day.My daughter was really looking forward to meeting Disney characters throughout the park like we did in Disneyland in the US and Tokyo. But there were NONE. Not as single Disney character to meet and take a picture with. Overall our experience was frustrating, stressful and discouraging. Also expensive at over 300 Euro with parking (not including overpriced food). If there is anyone from Paris Disneyland with a bit of decency reading this I would expect and apology and a compensation.",0
36686,"Looked forward to this trip for months, the parks themselves are ok...ish, nothing that special though, we were a party of 6, myself and my 3 children, 15, 13 and 9, and my parents, parks were very clean and to be honest, the staff were pleasant enough and the park does look after the elderly and disabled very well, none of the rides were 'amazing', some were good yes, but no better than other theme parks, at least 4 of the main attractions were closed for refurbishments(disappointing), but there were still quite a few of enjoyable rides for all ages. The food on site was astronomically priced, if it wasn't for the McDonalds in Disneyland village, we would have been broke on the second day, we spent 1 day in the Disney park, 1 day in the Disney studio park and 1 day shared between them both, that is certainly long enough, once you've been on a ride and seen it all, there's very little else to do, i think 3 days would suffice, the Disney village is full of overpriced shops and restaurants and thats about it apart from McDonalds, which hadn't upped their prices, so i would highly recommend you eat there for a hot meal. We stayed at the hotel Chayenne, tidy enough rooms, but no kettle or hair drier, pretty basic, but thats all you need really, you don't go all that way and pay that much money to stay in your hotel room, cold buffet breakfast was a nightmare, no hot food available, cereal, ham rolls(make some extra, put in your bag for snacks in the parks), croisants, toast and tea, coffee and juice. When we arrived at the hotel after 8 solid hours of travelling with oap and 3 children, we were told that they did not have a room for us, ridiculous, as we had paid nearly   2000 for the trip in advance, that's really not what you want to hear at that point, they wanted to shuttle us to a different hotel at 20 past 10 in the evening, not a chance, we stayed put and the finally got some other guests to transfer, shapeless. We were then given rooms quite a way from the main building, when we had specifically booked close accomodation because of my elderly mother with asthma and a pacemaker and more, the whole booking in was a terrible nightmare and tarnished the first part of what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime. We were starving, so went to the restaurant, which only had 20 mins left open, it's just got one price, an eat all you want buffet style thing, we stopped the man ringing up the price when he got to 160 euros without drinks, we had pot noodles in our room instead, with our own kettle, what a state of affairs. I'm glad that we can say we've been there and done that, but i will never go there again, a big load of hype for a lot of money and treated like cattle, but to be fair, i know a few people who go on a regular basis, maybe we were just unlucky, but i'm not prepared to take the chance again at 2 grand a pop.",0
31986,"Arrived here before 10am, had to pay 20 euros parking on top of the   110 for 2 tickets. Took over 90 mins to get in to the place even with tickets booked in advance to find that most rides already had waiting times of 50   100 mins!! Even to see a disney character! Most queues were not shaded which on a hot sunny day (34 degrees C) is very difficult! So we decided to get fast pass tickets. Yay! Not.. We got our first fast pass and had to wait 5 hours to use it and then found we couldn't get a second fast pass for 2 hours.. To get a fast pass on one of the rides would have left us waiting until 10pm... Then there's the food. Good luck finding somewhere to sit once you've got your tray of food that's just cost you a fortune and you waited an hour for.. We sat on the floor..After walking around endlessly we left at 3pm without getting on a single ride.. So as you can tell, we had a great time!",0
